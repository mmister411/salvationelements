0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.900,4.900000095367432," This is a really good verse to go to, to make the point that sometimes literal interpretation"
1,00:00:04.900,00:00:07.900,3.0, and over-literalizing things just totally misses the point.
2,00:00:07.900,00:00:11.939,4.039999485015869," The point of this verse is not that, oh, in the new earth, there won't be any salt water."
3,00:00:11.939,00:00:16.219,4.279999732971191, I guess that's good. I don't like dolphins anyway.
4,00:00:16.219,00:00:21.079,4.85999870300293," So once this battle is over, the battle of Armageddon, is that when the new heaven on earth comes?"
5,00:00:21.079,00:00:25.799,4.719999313354492," Yeah, in this case, we actually sort of get a decent narrative of events."
6,00:00:25.799,00:00:34.119,8.319999694824219," If you go to Revelation 20, let's just go to verse 9, it's describing this final conflict."
7,00:00:34.119,00:00:38.879,4.760002136230469, They marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints in the beloved city.
8,00:00:38.879,00:00:43.999,5.119998931884766," Okay, so Jerusalem is surrounded, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them."
9,00:00:43.999,00:00:48.219,4.220001220703125, And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur
10,00:00:48.219,00:00:53.479,5.259998321533203," where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
11,00:00:53.479,00:00:56.239,2.7600021362304688, Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.
12,00:00:56.239,00:01:00.519,4.279998779296875," From his presence, earth and sky fled away and no place was found for them."
13,00:01:00.519,00:01:04.500,3.9800033569335938," And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne and the books were opened."
14,00:01:04.500,00:01:07.259,2.7599945068359375," And another book was opened, which is the book of life."
15,00:01:07.259,00:01:11.519,4.260002136230469, And the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done.
16,00:01:11.519,00:01:13.699,2.1800003051757812, And the sea gave up the dead who were in it.
17,00:01:13.699,00:01:16.939,3.2399978637695312, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.
18,00:01:16.939,00:01:20.759,3.8199996948242188, And they were judged each one of them according to what they had done.
19,00:01:20.759,00:01:24.100,3.3400039672851562, Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
20,00:01:24.100,00:01:27.280,3.1800003051757812," This is the second death, the lake of fire."
21,00:01:27.280,00:01:32.359,5.079994201660156," And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."
22,00:01:32.359,00:01:38.039,5.680000305175781," So, you know, at the end of the judgment day of the Lord, we have the final judgment."
23,00:01:38.039,00:01:42.019,3.9800033569335938," We have the destruction of Satan, we have the destruction of the false prophet."
24,00:01:42.019,00:01:45.119,3.0999984741210938," Basically, all the forces of evil are going to be destroyed."
25,00:01:45.119,00:01:48.839,3.720001220703125," The righteous who are in the book of life are going to be vindicated, so on and so forth."
26,00:01:48.839,00:01:52.600,3.7600021362304688," And then if you look at verse 21, here's the answer to the question."
27,00:01:52.600,00:01:54.979,2.3799972534179688, Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
28,00:01:54.979,00:01:59.799,4.819999694824219, For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more.
29,00:01:59.799,00:02:03.100,3.3000030517578125," Which is actually one of my favorite verses in the New Testament,"
30,00:02:03.100,00:02:07.519,4.4199981689453125," because this is a really good verse to go to, to make the point that"
31,00:02:07.519,00:02:13.139,5.6199951171875, sometimes literal interpretation and over literalizing things just totally misses the point.
32,00:02:13.139,00:02:17.600,4.4600067138671875," The point of this verse is not that, oh, in the new earth, there won't be any salt water."
33,00:02:17.600,00:02:21.960,4.3600006103515625, I guess that's good. I don't like dolphins anyway.
34,00:02:21.960,00:02:24.199,2.239990234375," No, that isn't the point."
35,00:02:24.199,00:02:30.219,6.0200042724609375, The point is not a comment about whether there's sea water or salt water or not.
36,00:02:30.219,00:02:32.939,2.720001220703125, The sea was a symbol for chaos.
37,00:02:32.939,00:02:39.659,6.720001220703125, The sea is a symbol of anti-Eden. And that is no more.
38,00:02:39.659,00:02:44.419,4.7599945068359375, So you have this restoration of Eden imagery. It's this perfect place.
39,00:02:44.419,00:02:48.279,3.8600006103515625," I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,"
40,00:02:48.279,00:02:50.739,2.4600067138671875, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
41,00:02:50.739,00:02:52.559,1.8199920654296875," I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,"
42,00:02:52.559,00:02:55.900,3.3400115966796875," Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man."
43,00:02:55.900,00:02:58.059,2.1599884033203125, He will dwell with them and they will be his people.
44,00:02:58.059,00:03:00.960,2.9000091552734375," Which again, is a familiar Old Testament language."
45,00:03:00.960,00:03:03.040,2.0800018310546875, God himself will be with them as their God.
46,00:03:03.040,00:03:06.159,3.1199951171875, He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more.
47,00:03:06.159,00:03:09.239,3.0800018310546875," That sounds like Eden again, an unfallen Eden."
48,00:03:09.239,00:03:14.320,5.0800018310546875, Neither shall there be mourning or crying or pain anymore for the former things have passed away.
49,00:03:14.320,00:03:20.159,5.839996337890625," You go through the whole, the New Jerusalem, down in Revelation 21.9."
50,00:03:20.159,00:03:22.579,2.4199981689453125," You know, the description there, we have,"
51,00:03:22.579,00:03:25.040,2.4600067138671875," Spirit carries him to a great high mountain,"
52,00:03:25.040,00:03:29.120,4.0800018310546875, showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.
53,00:03:29.120,00:03:32.120,3.0," And then it's the gemstones, the luminosity."
54,00:03:32.120,00:03:35.999,3.8799896240234375," Remember the stones of fire, which is something we talked about a little bit earlier."
55,00:03:35.999,00:03:41.659,5.660003662109375," Again, you get this cosmic Edenic garden, earth, cosmic mountain, cosmic garden."
56,00:03:41.659,00:03:48.519,6.8600006103515625," All these images sort of converge in the end into this one place, the New Jerusalem."
57,00:03:48.519,00:03:54.159,5.6399993896484375, There's a lot of symbolism going on here that combines a lot of things that have preceded it
58,00:03:54.159,00:03:55.299,1.1399993896484375, in the Old Testament.
59,00:03:55.299,00:04:00.400,5.100006103515625," The way the dwelling of God is described in 5, 10, 15 passages,"
60,00:04:00.400,00:04:04.519,4.1199951171875, they all sort of conglomerate into this one.
61,00:04:04.519,00:04:08.559,4.0399932861328125," And again, that's deliberate because all of those things were precursors."
62,00:04:08.559,00:04:11.239,2.6800079345703125, All of them were foreshadowings.
63,00:04:11.239,00:04:14.759,3.519989013671875, All of them were lesser versions of this.
64,00:04:14.759,00:04:18.039,3.279998779296875, And so all of them contribute to its description.
65,00:04:18.039,00:04:21.199,3.160003662109375, You get the river of life in chapter 22.
66,00:04:21.199,00:04:25.440,4.240020751953125, The angel showed me the river of the water of life brought its brightest crystal flowing
67,00:04:25.440,00:04:29.079,3.639984130859375, from the throne of God and the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city.
68,00:04:29.079,00:04:32.120,3.040008544921875," And then you get this Edenic description, the tree of life."
69,00:04:32.120,00:04:34.519,2.399993896484375, No longer is there anything accursed.
70,00:04:34.519,00:04:38.239,3.720001220703125," The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, his servants worshipping with him."
71,00:04:38.239,00:04:39.879,1.639984130859375, Night will be no more.
72,00:04:39.879,00:04:43.440,3.560028076171875, They will have no need of lamp or sun for the Lord God will be their light
73,00:04:43.440,00:04:45.639,2.199981689453125, and they will reign forever and ever.
74,00:04:45.639,00:04:49.879,4.239990234375," So these last two chapters are, again, by design,"
75,00:04:49.879,00:04:55.160,5.280029296875," I mean, even the tree of life for the healing of the nations, you get that line."
76,00:04:55.160,00:04:56.919,1.759979248046875, Everything just converges.
77,00:04:56.919,00:05:03.919,7.0," Revelation 21 and 22, again, ought not to be overly literalized, because if you do that,"
78,00:05:03.919,00:05:08.599,4.67999267578125, you're trying to paint a picture of it or build a Lego model of it and that isn't the point.
79,00:05:08.599,00:05:14.120,5.52001953125," The point is that all of these images and all of the thoughts, the concepts they convey"
80,00:05:14.120,00:05:20.319,6.199981689453125," prior to this time, beginning with Eden, all the way through Eden, tabernacle, Zion,"
81,00:05:20.319,00:05:24.879,4.55999755859375," all these different mountains, temples, all of this talk and its description,"
82,00:05:24.879,00:05:28.359,3.480010986328125," again, just accumulates into this."
83,00:05:28.359,00:05:33.280,4.920013427734375, And I think the reason it's done is that so you can't miss it.
84,00:05:33.280,00:05:38.319,5.03997802734375," You know, it's so unusual, and you can pick parts of it and find parts of it elsewhere"
85,00:05:38.319,00:05:41.759,3.44000244140625," in the Old Testament for cosmic geography and sacred space,"
86,00:05:41.759,00:05:46.079,4.32000732421875, that you can't miss the point that all of these things feed into this.
87,00:05:46.079,00:05:48.840,2.760009765625, This is the ultimate endpoint for all of it.
88,00:05:48.840,00:05:51.799,2.959991455078125," And again, in the context of the book of Revelation,"
89,00:05:51.799,00:05:55.919,4.1199951171875, believers get to share the reign of the Messiah.
90,00:05:55.919,00:06:00.919,5.0," And if I could say one last thing about that, when we think about inheriting the earth,"
91,00:06:00.919,00:06:04.560,3.6400146484375," the earth being a global Eden and we reign and rule with Christ,"
92,00:06:04.560,00:06:07.840,3.279998779296875," all those are legitimate biblical ideas, obviously."
93,00:06:07.840,00:06:13.720,5.8800048828125," But we need to not think of those things in terms of, who do I get to be the boss of?"
94,00:06:13.720,00:06:16.840,3.1199951171875," This is typically where our mind goes, like, who do I outrank?"
95,00:06:16.840,00:06:20.519,3.67999267578125," Do I outrank my wife or my husband, you know, my kids,"
96,00:06:20.519,00:06:24.400,3.8800048828125," the guy at work that I really don't like, but I know he's a believer, you know."
97,00:06:24.400,00:06:28.759,4.3599853515625, We tend to think in this hierarchical sense. That isn't the point.
98,00:06:28.759,00:06:34.319,5.55999755859375," Point is, it reverts back. It's the reset button back to Eden,"
99,00:06:34.319,00:06:40.840,6.52001953125, where everybody is imaging God. Everybody belongs there. Everybody's in sacred space.
100,00:06:40.840,00:06:47.680,6.839996337890625," And what we're ruling is really the thing that God made for human habitation, which is the world."
101,00:06:47.680,00:06:54.199,6.519989013671875, It's not ruling other people. It's enjoying Eden for what it was originally intended to be.
102,00:06:54.199,00:06:58.799,4.600006103515625," So it will be what it was intended to be and we will enjoy it and sustain it, maintain it,"
103,00:06:58.799,00:07:01.000,2.20001220703125," use it, utilize it, repurpose it."
104,00:07:01.000,00:07:04.639,3.639984130859375, We'll do the things that God wanted us to do with creation
105,00:07:04.639,00:07:10.479,5.839996337890625," in an eternal stewardship of what it is, and enjoying it for what it was intended to be."
