The point of this verse is not that, oh, in the new earth, there won't be any salt water. I guess that's good. I don't like dolphins anyway. So once this battle is over, the battle of Armageddon, is that when the new heaven on earth comes? Yeah, in this case, we actually sort of get a decent narrative of events. If you go to Revelation 20, let's just go to verse 9, it's describing this final conflict.

They marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints in the beloved city. Okay, so Jerusalem is surrounded, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them. And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence, earth and sky fled away and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. And they were judged each one of them according to what they had done.

Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. So, you know, at the end of the judgment day of the Lord, we have the final judgment. We have the destruction of Satan, we have the destruction of the false prophet. Basically, all the forces of evil are going to be destroyed. The righteous who are in the book of life are going to be vindicated, so on and so forth.

And then if you look at verse 21, here's the answer to the question. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more. Which is actually one of my favorite verses in the New Testament, because this is a really good verse to go to, to make the point that sometimes literal interpretation and over literalizing things just totally misses the point.

The point of this verse is not that, oh, in the new earth, there won't be any salt water. I guess that's good. I don't like dolphins anyway. No, that isn't the point. The point is not a comment about whether there's sea water or salt water or not. The sea was a symbol for chaos. The sea is a symbol of anti-Eden. And that is no more.

So you have this restoration of Eden imagery. It's this perfect place. I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them and they will be his people. Which again, is a familiar Old Testament language.
        Copy



God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more. That sounds like Eden again, an unfallen Eden. Neither shall there be mourning or crying or pain anymore for the former things have passed away.
        Copy



You go through the whole, the New Jerusalem, down in Revelation 21:9. You know, the description there, we have, Spirit carries him to a great high mountain, showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God. And then it's the gemstones, the luminosity. Remember the stones of fire, which is something we talked about a little bit earlier.
        Copy



Again, you get this cosmic Edenic garden, earth, cosmic mountain, cosmic garden. All these images sort of converge in the end into this one place, the New Jerusalem. There's a lot of symbolism going on here that combines a lot of things that have preceded it in the Old Testament.
        Copy



The way the dwelling of God is described in 5, 10, 15 passages, they all sort of conglomerate into this one. And again, that's deliberate because all of those things were precursors. All of them were foreshadowings. All of them were lesser versions of this. And so all of them contribute to its description.
        Copy



You get the river of life in chapter 22. The angel showed me the river of the water of life brought its brightest crystal flowing from the throne of God and the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city. And then you get this Edenic description, the tree of life.
        Copy



No longer is there anything accursed. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, his servants worshipping with him. Night will be no more. They will have no need of lamp or sun for the Lord God will be their light and they will reign forever and ever.
        Copy



So these last two chapters are, again, by design, I mean, even the tree of life for the healing of the nations, you get that line. Everything just converges.
        Copy



Revelation 21 and 22 again ought not to be overly literalized because if you do that you're trying to paint a picture of it or build a Lego model of it and that isn't the point.
        Copy



The point is that all of these images and all of the thoughts, concepts they convey prior to this time beginning with Eden all the way through Eden tabernacle Zion all these different mountains temples all talks in its description again just accumulates into this.
        Copy



I think the reason it's done is that so you can't miss it. You know it's so unusual and you can pick parts of it and find parts elsewhere in Old Testament for cosmic geography and sacred space that you can't miss point that all these things feed into this ultimate endpoint for all.
        Copy



And again in context book believers share reign Messiah lastly think inheriting earth being global ruling Christ legitimate biblical ideas think those terms outrank hierarchical sense reset button back Eden imaging God belongs sacred space enjoy inhabitation ruling people enjoying intended sustain maintain utilize repurpose so stewardship creation eternal intended intended.
