            <p>This is a really good verse to go to, to make the point that sometimes literal interpretation and over-literalizing things just totally misses the point. The point of this verse is not that, oh, in the new earth, there won't be any salt water. I guess that's good. I don't like dolphins anyway. So once this battle is over, the battle of Armageddon, is that when the new heaven on earth comes? Yeah, in this case, we actually sort of get a decent narrative of events. If you go to Revelation 20, let's just go to verse 9, it's describing this final conflict.

            <p>They marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints in the beloved city. Okay, so Jerusalem is surrounded, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them. And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

            <p>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence, earth and sky fled away and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. And they were judged each one of them according to what they had done.

            <p>Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. So, you know, at the end of the judgment day of the Lord, we have the final judgment. We have the destruction of Satan, we have the destruction of the false prophet. Basically, all the forces of evil are going to be destroyed. The righteous who are in the book of life are going to be vindicated, so on and so forth.

            <p>And then if you look at verse 21, here's the answer to the question. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more. Which is actually one of my favorite verses in the New Testament, because this is a really good verse to go to, to make the point that sometimes literal interpretation and over literalizing things just totally misses the point.

The point is not a comment about whether there's sea water or salt water or not. The sea was a symbol for chaos. The sea is a symbol of anti-Eden. And that is no more.

            <p>So you have this restoration of Eden imagery. It's this perfect place. I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them and they will be his people. Which again, is a familiar Old Testament language.

You know, the description there, we have, Spirit carries him to a great high mountain, showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God. And then it's the gemstones, the luminosity. Remember the stones of fire, which is something we talked about a little bit earlier.

            <p>Again, you get this cosmic Edenic garden, earth, cosmic mountain, cosmic garden. All these images sort of converge in the end into this one place, the New Jerusalem. There's a lot of symbolism going on here that combines a lot of things that have preceded it in the Old Testament.

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Once this battle is over, the battle of Armageddon, then the new heaven on earth comes.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">A decent narrative of events is described in Revelation 20.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Revelation 20:9 is describing a final conflict.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">They marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints in the beloved city.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Jerusalem is surrounded.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Fire came down from heaven and consumed them.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The devil, the beast, and the false prophet will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Then a great white throne and the one who is seated on it were seen.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">From his presence, earth and sky fled away and no place was found for them.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The dead, great and small, were seen standing before the throne and the books were opened.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Another book was opened, which is the book of life.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The sea gave up the dead who were in it.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">All the forces of evil are going to be destroyed.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The righteous who are in the book of life are going to be vindicated.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">A new heaven and a new earth were seen, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The sea was a symbol for chaos and that is no more.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">A holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, was seen.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The holy city was prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">A loud voice from the throne said, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them and they will be his people."</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Neither shall there be mourning or crying or pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Spirit carried him to a great high mountain and showed him the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The holy city is described with gemstones and luminosity.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The last two chapters of Revelation combine a lot of things that have preceded in the Old Testament.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The description of the dwelling of God is a convergence of various imagery and themes from the Old Testament.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The river of life, as bright as crystal, flows from the throne of God and the Lamb.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The river of life flows through the middle of the street of the city.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There is a tree of life, and nothing accursed will be there.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Night will be no more.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">They will have no need of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">They will reign forever and ever.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The New Jerusalem is described in Revelation 21 and 22.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">All of the images and concepts conveyed prior to this time accumulate in the ultimate endpoint.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Believers get to share the reign of the Messiah in the context of the book of Revelation.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The earth will be a global Eden where believers reign and rule with Christ.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The intention is an eternal stewardship of creation, enjoying it as it was originally intended to be.</li>
