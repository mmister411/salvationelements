Akef Tayem
----------

### Details

Akef Tayem, a former Muslim who founded Sons of Abraham and authored the book 'From the Crescent to the Cross,' recounts his journey from Islam to Christianity, which was profoundly influenced by his near-death experience. He details this experience in his book, on his website, and in interviews. Akef Tayem's near-death experience, which he vividly recounts, took place over thirty years ago in Trussville, Alabama. His journey began with feelings of isolation and disconnection from society, leading him to seek solace in a remote area. He describes driving through a dense forest, feeling restless and seeking a place of quiet reflection​​. 

In his narrative, Tayem describes a period where he went without food for about forty days while in a forest in Alabama. During this time, he had a profound experience where he encountered the silhouette of a man who approached him and spoke to him​​. Tayem identifies this figure as Jesus, who appeared to him and said 'Touch Me'. Upon doing so, Tayem was miraculously brought back to life​​.

This transformative experience is a cornerstone of Tayem's testimony and has been shared on various platforms, including the television show 'It's Supernatural'​​​​. His experience not only led to his conversion to Christianity but also inspired him to share his story through his book and his work with Sons of Abraham, an organization aimed at bridging gaps between different faiths.

Tayem's experience reflects a common theme in many near-death experiences: a transformative encounter that leads to significant life changes and spiritual revelations. His account is especially notable for its detailed description of the encounter and its profound impact on his life and beliefs. Tayem's story is one of many that contribute to the broader understanding of near-death experiences within the context of religious and spiritual conversions.

During this profound experience, Tayem encountered a figure he instantly recognized as Jesus, despite only seeing a silhouette. He could not discern specific facial features but could make out the outline of a robe, shoulder-length hair, and bare feet. This figure approached him and invited him to "Touch me"​​.

Tayem also narrates an intriguing vision where he saw a human heart, alive and beating, with what appeared like tentacles moving inside it. He realized in disbelief that he was looking at his own heart. This vision, which he found deeply unsettling, made him question his lifestyle and beliefs, as he had considered himself to be living a morally upright life​​.

Further, Tayem describes a sensation of moving upwards, surrounded by darkness, feeling weightless and without substance. He passed through well-lit areas several times before stopping in a place that seemed like soft, white wool. This sensation of weightlessness and the ethereal environment he describes are common elements in many near-death experiences​​.

These excerpts from Tayem's testimony provide a detailed and personal account of his near-death experience, reflecting both the spiritual and emotional dimensions of such experiences. His story is a testament to the profound impact these experiences can have on an individual's beliefs, life direction, and spiritual understanding.

Aline Baxley

### Details
Aline Baxley's near-death experience, particularly her journey through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and her descent into Hell, is a vivid and intense narrative. Her experience, as described in various sources, offers a profound and detailed look into her perception of these spiritual realms.

1.  **The Valley of the Shadow of Death:** After her car accident, Baxley describes finding herself in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, depicted as a place of immense darkness and fear. Unable to see her own hands, she was overwhelmed by the darkness and her own sinfulness. Despite her love for the 23rd Psalm, she found herself unable to take comfort in its words, feeling unworthy and undone before God. In this valley, she perceived the Word of God becoming a living presence, interceding for her soul​[](https://fliphtml5.com/fbvn/ojeu/ALINE_BAXLEY_AFTER_THE_ACCIDEN_-_Divine_Revelations/)​.

2.  **Encounter with the Death Angel:** In her experience, Baxley describes the appearance of the mighty Death Angel. This entity was perceived as an executor of divine will, present to enact the separation of her soul from the Lord. The Death Angel's role was to carry her into the depths of outer darkness, leading her into Hell​[](https://fliphtml5.com/fbvn/ojeu/ALINE_BAXLEY_AFTER_THE_ACCIDEN_-_Divine_Revelations/)​.

3.  **Hell and the Second Death:** Baxley's narrative of Hell is one of anguish and despair, with souls by the hundreds and thousands screaming and gnashing their teeth in agony, unable to die. This experience underlined her belief in two types of death: the physical death of the body and a subsequent spiritual death where the soul faces God's judgment. In Hell, she saw the Lake of Fire, described as a place of total darkness with red-hot flames, where even the third of the angels were bound in chains of darkness​[](https://fliphtml5.com/fbvn/ojeu/ALINE_BAXLEY_AFTER_THE_ACCIDEN_-_Divine_Revelations/)​.

4.  Divine Revelation and Forgiveness: During her time in a coma, Baxley describes a period of waiting in the dark valley, feeling unworthy in the presence of a holy light. She reports hearing the voice of God, quoting Romans 11:29, which speaks to the unrepentant nature of God's gifts and calling. This led to a profound moment of repentance and plea for forgiveness from Baxley, signifying a turning point in her spiritual experience​[](https://fliphtml5.com/fbvn/ojeu/ALINE_BAXLEY_AFTER_THE_ACCIDEN_-_Divine_Revelations/)​.

Aline Baxley's near-death experience paints a vivid picture of Christian eschatological themes, highlighting the depths of despair and darkness in Hell contrasted with the possibility of divine mercy and forgiveness. Her experience emphasizes the Christian belief in the eternal nature of the soul and the importance of living a life aligned with God's will.

3\. **Crying Out for God and Feeling of Separation**: Throughout her experience, Baxley frequently mentions crying out to God, reflecting her desperate longing for divine intervention and salvation.
