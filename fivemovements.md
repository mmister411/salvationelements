Five Flights of Faithfulness

Every soul, situation and sunrise to sunset is different.  Variety, spontaneity, and choices are inherent to life.  Nevertheless the LORD is One LORD, what is good remains good.  Under the power of the Holy Spirit it is possible for choices not to be contrary to scripture.  This document sets out to distill to five areas that if all are present or align to the walk of the redeemed then to hear "Well done good and faithful servant" is the promise of His Word. There remains no secret list to tally up to a transacting of redemption but it yet remains "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?" Conversely, "how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?" "Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart."
