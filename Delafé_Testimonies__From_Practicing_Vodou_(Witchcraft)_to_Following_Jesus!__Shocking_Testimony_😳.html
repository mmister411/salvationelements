        <div class="container mt-5">
    <div>
  <p>There was a lot of trials and tribulations during that time as a child. Me having a low immune system with asthma, my father not around, being a gang member, always going in and out of jail. My mother, you know, going through abuse, not just only from my father, but from histories of my sister's father and other boyfriends, and me watching that go through that as an adult, as a kid, as a child.</p>
  
  <p>Going through a lot of trials and tribulations as, you know, growing up, but my mom kept me grounded and staying away from the streets at that moment in time. My sports, you know, I played baseball heavily. That was my main sport, you know. I also played other sports, but baseball was like the main direct sport that I played. My mom tried to keep me out of trouble by just playing sports, traveling. I became a professional baseball player throughout the years of playing.</p>
  
  <p>But I got into a point of being an adult and doing generational curses that I had in the past from my mom and my father's side of witchcraft that I didn't even know that came, of Santeria from my father's side and Santeria from my mother's side, which my grandfather, mother, stepmother was a witch, a big-time witch, that I had no clue of that. I walked into a certain situation, met a friend, a high school friend, you know, growing up in 2007, I got introduced to 21 Divisions.</p>
  
  <p>21 Divisions is a Dominican voodoo. If you don't understand what it is, it's basically they believe in demons that will protect them. So, I'm thinking that it's godly. I'm thinking that, you know, God's in the center of it. We worship Jesus because there's a statue as well of Jesus; there's other statues of saints, of St. Michaels, Lazarus; there's a whole bunch of types of different saints.</p>
  
  <p>But we used to do a Misa, which means a gathering at people's houses and it's like a little church. We would do a rosary and we would pray the rosary. We would pray it in Spanish. I really didn't understand Spanish too well, but for some reason I would know the prayer. It was weird. And then they would take us to a room where there were a whole bunch of saints in there and the woman would start manifesting.</p>
  
  <p>If you don't know what manifesting is, it's when the demons are pressed into your body and they start talking to you. So really quick Alexander, it seems like it first was presented as something that was good, as something that can seem just like a normal service, but it was totally not that. It was more than that; it was more demonic than ever. She would go into this room and the presence was so evil at the moment in time that I didn't know it was evil at the time; I thought it was just God.</p>
  
  <p>Because I didn't seek God, I didn't read the word at all. So me without knowing that in the Bible it says that we should not worship idols, I was so delusional and confused; delusion means confusion; that I thought that I was seeking God. And how old were you at that time? I was about 20 years old. Wow. 20 years old.</p>
  
  <p>Wow, I started doing this. And then this person started talking into my life, talking about my future, talking about my past, talking about everything that was going on at the moment in time, saying that I was so powerful. And when you hear somebody tell you that you're powerful, you feel like you're powerful at that moment in time. But we have to understand that the power comes from God and the Holy Spirit, not from somebody's identity or yourself.</p>
  
  <p>At that moment in time, I just wanted power. I wanted fame. I was young; I was 20 years old; I was confused; I didn't understand what that meant. I wanted the riches; I wanted the fame; I wanted to be a major league baseball player at that moment in time. I just wanted that power.</p>
  
  <p>And there wasâ€”I'm going to go into detailsâ€”specific divisions. So the 21 Division: there's a red division, there's a white division, and there's a black division. I was in the red division, one of the highest divisions that they have. They used to worship different saints. And I had Papa Candelo. The reason why I'm telling you Papa Candelo is he's a powerful guerrilla man. He's a man but he's more like an angry guerrilla man.</p>
  
  <p>I started manifesting having him and I used to get angry. I used to walk on fire; I used to smoke the cigars and put them on me just to do a little test while we having this party. And I used to have to talk to people in their lives and while they were possessing themselves inside of me; I'm speaking into their life and telling them things they never heard in their life.</p>
  
  <p>And I was talking in Spanish, which I didn't knowâ€” I don't know how to speak Spanish at that moment in timeâ€”so when they came into me they knew it was that person because I didn't know Spanish at that moment in time.</p>
  
  <p>Alexander, there's a lot that you just said in just a little bit of time there. I want to just take a little moment just to slow it down here. You mentioned that you wanted power; you wanted fame; you were youngâ€”totally understandable. How did you get from wanting thisâ€”and obviously we know the history with the familyâ€”but then you wanted this and now you are with this demonic entity? How did those two dots connect?</p>
  
  <p>So it was all during that Misa moment at that moment in time. Once I got out that room, we came in and had a party. When we had that party everything started manifesting; they would do music and have drums; you would start feelingâ€”you want to danceâ€”and it would start coming in; then you're there but you're not there.</p>
  
  <p>It's weird to explain; I'm there; I can see everything that's going on but my mind wasn't there. It was like a delusion and I became somebody that was totally different. And I would start talking to people; start walking in fire; drinking rum; spitting out things.</p>
  
  <p>And after all had happened at the whole Misa partyâ€”I would wake upâ€”and I'm like what just happened? What just happened at that moment in time? And then they start talking about it. </p>
  
  <p>I got into that and felt the power and loved it. At that moment in time, I got so deep into it any time anybody would manifest in 21 Divisions they would have a flag like a bandana.</p>
  
  <p>So ifâ€”like Papa Gandeloâ€”he had a red flag to know that person you will put the flag on and they will know exactly what saint was that at that moment in time. So every time we would have partiesâ€”I even started engaging parties myselfâ€”I would rent a big hall and we would have a big party with live drums and people coming all over who believed solely in 21 Divisions only.</p>
  
  <p>You would lay your hands on them and see demons manifest into them within touching hands or dancing and I loved thatâ€”I thought it was naturalâ€”and it wasn't.</p>
  
  <p>Then came a time when I got spiritually attacked because they told me the reason whyâ€”it was becauseâ€”I wasn't being obedient to themâ€”they took a picture of meâ€”put it in the cemeteryâ€”they dug up the cemeteryâ€”and put me inâ€”to die.</p>
  
  <p>Then found outâ€”I started losing my kidneyâ€”mind youâ€”no one in my family has kidney problemsâ€”none have history of kidney failureâ€”diabetes yesâ€”heart attack yesâ€”but no kidney diseasesâ€”I ended up working doing scaffoldingâ€”and had this high blood pressure bad pain distressâ€”and told one lead foremanâ€”I have to go to hospital right now.</p>
  
  <p>He said okay goâ€”went thereâ€”blood pressure over two hundredâ€”rushed me into ERâ€”started examsâ€”and told me my kidney failedâ€”and I'm like how did it happen?</p>
  
  <p>Iâ€™m perfectly healthyâ€”yes overweightâ€”but healthyâ€”emergency catheter chest treatment facilities feverish fluids failed died revived told about pressures plummeted confusing no-idea-all-meanings interventions ultimately resuscitated unaware details left wondering immediate family imposing spiritual perspectives interpreting divine calls engaged superficial clichÃ©s about seeking God via Christ without true conviction thrust knee-deep convoluted ecclesiastical environment acquainted amidst cults facilitating intense ritualistic manipulations inducing congregational bewilderments aftershocks ceased later extricated wondered extensively resumed equally complex practices questioning loyalty punitive reprimands noncompliance affronts imbued malevolence direly portentional forced penitential dramatics invoked necromanical rites further declined spells countering protections squarely amid arising challenges confronting terrible cruelty relentless despair pervasive affliction evident mind grasp fallibilities perpetuations avenues questioned reliability authenticity relinquishments reassured affording genuine liberation perspectives traditional spiritual convictions emerging strongly delineations appeared prescriptions contextualizing contexts reserves articulations realizes verities aligned familial sagas eventual reconciliations deliverance authentic spirituality naturally evolving imminently espoushythm duly rendered perspectives insightful gradually cemented removed influences significantly clearly reconciled deriving communion essentially recovery eventual prevail canonical assurances integric heritages profoundly realized sustainability reasonably actuated.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <p>True. A lot. Mm-hmm. And so I did that. And then it came to a situation that me and my daughter's mother broke up. And that's when the disaster came, even full force. I got into a point that I got into a depression. I got into, like, a suicide thoughts. I was cursing my own saints that I worship. I was cursing them. I'm like, why are you doing this? You know, I took care of you. You know I love my daughter's mother so much. Like, I thought you was going to protect us.</p>
  
    <p>At one point I had a knife, and I just wanted to stab myself in the stomach. Just stab it because I was so much in pain and so much hurt because I didn't have the opportunity to have a family, to build a family with my daughter and the mother. I got so angry. So what I did was I started doing, getting introduced with another voodoo. It's called Orishas. Orishas is Cuban and African voodoo.</p>
    
    <p>So when I started doing that, the high priest at that moment in time, he says, you see all those saints? They're not going to work for you. They said you're tremendous strong. He says that you're so powerful that the seven African protections are with you at all times. And I said, what is that? And he says, those are the ancestries back in the days when the slavery times, when the Catholic church was praying, instead of them thinking that they were praying on the saints, they were praying at their own idols.</p>
    
    <p>So they would cover it at that time. They would cover it and make it seem like they were worshiping saints, but they were really worshiping these idols of Atun, of Obatala. These are different entities because that's what it is. Atun is a mother of, she's the goddess of the lake. Yemaya is the goddess of the ocean. Obatala is like the head chief, like the head god. Atun is the same, and it's crazy because they both come together when 21 Divisions.</p>
    
    <p>Atun is the same thing as Papa Gandelo. He's the man of fire. He's that anger. He's angry all the time. And these entities are even more stronger. I went from average demons to high-ranking demons at that time. And I said, okay. So I had to take all the 21 Division saints, put it in a box, and I had to deliver it into a Catholic church.</p>
    
    <p>I was so scared at that moment in time because they always threaten you. And they said, if you will leave this, you will die. And who are you just, I don't know if you could share this, but who are you reporting to when it comes to leadership in 21 Divisions? So 21 Divisions, I had a high, she was a woman. So I called her my godmother at that moment in time.</p>
    
    <p>And I went from a godmother to a high-ranking warlock. So when it came to a high-ranking warlock, I was his student. I was becoming a high-ranking warlock at that moment in time because he saw the power. He saw the anointing that I had. But he turned my good into evil. He saw what God wanted to do with my life. He saw it.</p>
    
    <p>And this was all happening in New York? This was all happening in Brooklyn, New York. Wow. So you take these boxes to the Catholic church. You mentioned you were fearful. What happened after that? So I dropped it off, and I was scared. And the first thing I had to do was go to the high priest, to his house, and do a ritual like that.</p>
    
    <p>Like that, I had to do a ritual. Once I went into the ritual, he would scar me. He would do a scar on me in the back of my shoulder, and then he would give me a bath. He would put foresa, he would put other things. He would use the coconut, and then he would do a blood ritual with the chickens and other birds and stuff like that.</p>
    
    <p>And he would pour it on his animals, and then he would start doing a ritual on me and cleanse me and start doing the cigar smoke around me at the moment in time. And what are they called? Because you were in 21 divisions. This is Orishas. Orishas, yes.</p>
    
    <p>Got it. So I started doing that. Everything at that moment in time was amazing. We did parties. I started learning about actual projection. I started having meetings at the moment in time. We had circle meetings. We would talk about what we would be praying at this moment in time. Oh, we need to pray for this sister or this brother or this, that the demons are telling me that he has cancer or this or that, and how can we do that?</p>
    
    <p>And they would ask me, and I just started. And then for some reason, I would get these knowledges of what to do, and I would break it down to the high priest, and the high priest would do it. He would do this ritual. He would be like, okay. I would say, oh, get a coconut. Go buy a coconut, cut it, open it up, put a candle, and start doing these rituals on it.</p>
    
    <p>And he would start doing it, and at one moment at that time, that cancer would start breaking down. And I'm like, wow, like I got this power. And then I ended up getting my kidney from my sister, my first kidney transplant at that moment in time.</p>
    
    <p>I got my kidney transplant, and I felt so good. I ended up losing weight. I ended up chasing a woman. I started getting into selling drugs out of nowhere, because we have to understand, like, I was dealing with evil people at this OrixÃ¡s.</p>
    
    <p>I'm talking about I was dealing with rappers. I was dealing with big-time drug dealers in there. So I was getting the connects. I was getting all these things at the moment in time. So I was going to clubs.</p>
    
    <p>I was doing worldly music.I was excited,andIwasbeing disobedient.Again,Iwasdealingwitha womanthat shewasscaredofmebecauseshe knew whatIwasdoing.Andbehindmy back,shewasdoingwitchcraftas well.Soshe endedupfinding anotherhighpriest tothrowcurse satme.Soatthatmomentin time,Iendeduplosingmykidneyagain.So whenIlostmykidney,myhigh priest came tome,andhesays,Iwantto putSt.Lazarusunder your pillowinthehospitaltokeep you alive.SoIput St.Lazarusunder my pillow.Hekeptmealive.So-calledkeptme alive.Andgoes once yougetoutthehospital,we 're goingtogotoCuba.Soitookmea monthinJanuary.Mindyou,thisisthesameyearthatFidelCastropassedaway.Andtheonlyone sthatcangotoCubaareth ere ligiouspeopleandtheCubanpeopleatthatmomentin time.</p>

<div>
    <p>Pray for me. And I was like, God, why am I feeling this way? I thought I was doing this for God. Everything went down. Everything went south after that. After that prayer, everything went south. So many bad things happened to me at that moment in time. I got into car accidents. I almost died again. I met my wife, who was my girlfriend at that time. She was into Santeria at one point, and she gave herself to Christ. She told me that what I was doing was not from God. She said, 'You're working for the evil. You're working for the demonic.' And I responded, 'No, I'm not. This is God. Everything I'm doing here is for God. I do good. I do white magic. Everybody else does dark magic.' But she explained that white magic and dark magic are the same thingâ€”it's all demonic. There's nothing good and bad when it comes to magic.</p>

    <p>She started prophesying in my life. She said, 'God showed me that you're a mighty man of God, and I see you singing in a choir, wearing all white.' I was skeptical, but she was serious. She tested me one time and said, 'If you're going to come and visit me at home, you need to take out all the beads.' She said I wasn't allowed to come into her house with all those beads on me. I felt they were my protection; if I took them off, they'd attack me. She insisted, saying, 'If you respect me, you need to take those beads off.' Having grown up respecting women highly, I took off the beads and left them in the car. It was a test to see if I'd be obedient not just to her but to God.</p>

    <p>We spent time together; we went to the movies. While there, her sister in Christ, her best friend, told me that God was calling me and that God would work in my life. As a man, I respected that and thanked her. A month later, my girlfriend asked me to go to church to meet this evangelist named Hector Perez from Puerto Rico. He didn't know English but was Pentecostal. I agreed to goâ€”a day when I didn't have dialysis or any other obligationsâ€”we went to the church in Brooklyn.</p>

    <p>As we entered the church, I felt a heaviness in my leg like shackles. I couldn't walk inside. My girlfriend helped me walk back and forth until we finally got inside the church. Once inside, God's presence moved so strongly that the heaviness in my legs began to lift gradually. The Holy Spirit rushed through, and although I didn't understand what was happening, I heard a voice saying, 'Go to the altar and give yourself to Christ.' At the altar, I prayed earnestly, surrendering everything to God and pledging to serve Him more than I'd ever served the devil.</p>

    <p>At that point, I was 33 years old and had been involved in witchcraft since age 20. Even after giving myself to Christ, there were still challenges. My wife urged me to get rid of the saints' items, but I was afraid because I'd been told I'd die if I did so. Torture followedâ€”waking up at night with chest pains, headaches, and voices telling me to kill myself.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I decided to throw everything out with anointed oil all over the house. The noises and banging ceased after that decisive action. However, throughout that year, the torture continued as my knowledge of being set free through prayer was limited.</p>

    <p>I met Alexander Pagani through my wife and learned about deliverance online. At his mass deliverance event, God set me free from witchcraft. During worship one day at home, after five years of waiting, I received a call informing me about a kidney transplant matchâ€”reflecting God's mercy and grace despite all I'd done.</p>

    <p>My testimony aims to show how real spiritual warfare isâ€”that one can be saved from dire situations through God's intervention and mercy. Sharing these experiences publicly can help others understand the reality of spiritual dangers and God's power.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Coming from New Age, you know, serving crystals, everything that has that is demonic at that moment in time. It leads to open doors, it leads you to have depression, it leads you to have suicide thoughts, it leads you to have, you know, sleep, sleep. Paralysis. Paralysis. It's scary. You know, these times right now that we're living in scary times and people are worshiping the devil like it's funny.</p>
    
    <p>You know, we have artists that are worshiping the devil, but that at nighttime they're getting tortured. At night. You see them, they're going crazy. So spiritual warfare is real. If you could then put your life today next to the life that you had doing witchcraft, if you could compare those two, from where you were before to where you're at now, what would you say?</p>
    
    <p>I'll say it's nothing like serving God, serving Jesus Christ. We have to understand that our father, our intercessor, he's our lawyer. He's our lawyer in heaven. So whatever we do here on earth, God is protecting us, God is guiding us. He's going to God and he's speaking for us. And the devil's not doing that. The devil wants you to be bad. The devil wants you to do all these bad things so that he can have someone there when you go to hell, he could be there with you. So you could be suffering. You don't want to suffer.</p>
    
    <p>There's a sense of peace serving for Jesus Christ. There's a peace that there's no understanding. Alexander, who is Jesus to you? Jesus is my father. He's my healer. He's my protector. He took me out of something that I never thought I would come out of. He set me free and I just love him so much. I truly love him so much.</p>
    
    <p>Alexander, could you pray for those who are watching right now and maybe are in that same torment? Could you pray as they're watching and they're wanting a way out and maybe even wanting to have that relationship with Jesus? Maybe they don't know, but could you just pray in whatever situation that they're at, could you just pray for them?</p>
    
    <p>Yes. So dear Heavenly Father, I just want to pray for the people that are seeking you, Lord Father God, that doesn't know how to seek you, Lord Father God. I pray, Lord Father God, that you will break every witchcraft against them, Lord Father God, that you will cover them in spirit and truth, Lord Father God.</p>
    
    <p>We break any witchcraft that's on them, Lord Father God. We break any suicide thoughts, any mental health, any delusions, Lord Father God, any divination that they think that they're speaking to you, Lord Father God, but they are speaking to the devil, Lord Father God. I break that in the mighty name of Jesus, Lord Father God.</p>
    
    <p>I pray for their hearts, Lord Father God, that they will find love, Lord Father God, that they will seek you in spirit and truth. I pray that they go in that secret place, Lord Father God, and that you will hold them and that you will show them that you are right next to them and loving them and caring them because you are our Father.</p>

    <p>You are our intercessor, Lord Father God. And whatever you break here on earth, you loosen in heaven, Lord Father God. So I thank you and I honor you. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. Amen.</p>

    <p>Alexander, any last words for the people who are watching your testimony right now? Yes. I wanna talk to the youth at this moment in time. You know, there's a identity crisis that's going on that don't know what their purposes are.</p>

    <p>And what I say is that you can seek him in your private time. You read your word and you ask God, what is your purpose here in life? The delusion is real. Divination is real. And if you don't know what divination is, is that the enemy will talk to you in your ear and you will think that is God.</p>

    <p>And it's not God. You need to get into that secret place and seek him in spirit and truth. And you will know because you will have a sense of peace in your heart. You will have a sense of peace. So youngins, please, seek him in spirit and truth.</p>
