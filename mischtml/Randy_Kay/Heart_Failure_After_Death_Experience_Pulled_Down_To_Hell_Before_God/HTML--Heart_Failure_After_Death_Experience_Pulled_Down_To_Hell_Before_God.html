            <p>So I saw this being, he just looked horrible. He had this body of a lamb with fur that like glue, like slime was gluing it together. And he had a black, black wolf face and he had these piercing red beam eyes. And I saw this huge lion and this lion had eyes of fire and he had white fur with the tips appeared to be drenched in blood. And that was always the words I used since I came back.

            <p>Welcome to this episode of Heaven Encounters. My guest today, Camille Hall, suffered from cardiac disease for most of her life from early childhood. That led to cardiac arrest after she was told that if she didn't have a heart transplant within a period of time that she would die. And indeed she suffered from a cardiac arrest, experienced something very hellish, but she'll take us to heaven today. And this is gonna be absolutely amazing. So Camille, great to be with you today.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Well, Camille, you did suffer through most of your childhood and tell us about how that led up to your afterlife experience.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Sure. So in all my life, I've suffered with heart disease, so congenital heart disease. And so I just kind of had dealt with that, different things on and off. And I got a pacemaker when I was 18 and just have always dealt with things. But then in 2009, I ended up moving into a house that was full of toxic mold. And it's not the regular black mold that people see, so I like to not scare anybody by that, but we had it tested because it looked different. So we had it tested. And in fact, it was the 1% most harmful kind of mold.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And I had started, but before we knew that, this was a year after I came back from the hospital, but before we knew that, I became really ill. And my heart, just on a regular checkups, they said it was basically blowing up. It was, I had a huge enlarged heart, like it was growing rapidly, and they gave me a year to live without a heart transplant. At that time, that was August of 2012, I went home and God said, pray like you never have before because you don't want someone else's heart.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And I was just stunned by that. So I just prayed and prayed, and I honestly thought I was gonna die because they had told me that at the hospital. They said to get grief counselors for my family and prepare. And so I just started getting closer and closer to the Lord. I was already saved, thankfully, but that really showed me a lot.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>But then I got really sick. March of 2013, I was at my house, and for about three days, I ended up having just complete body aches and swelling, like you couldn't believe, like the swelling. I always say edema is probably the most underrated pain we have, and this horrible pain. And on the third day, I just, I remember, I'll just be quite frank, I remember urinating blood. And I looked down, I saw that, and then I got dizzy. And then I said, call 911 to my husband at the time, right then, for the first time in my life, I'd ever said that. And then I went into strokes.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>But I remember this lady coming to the house, and she was, I'll never forget it because she was so extremely demonic. And she told my husband to leave me there and to go in Monday because this was a Saturday. And I remember going, trying to struggle to say, no, no. But fortunately, he said, you're taking her in.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And then we got into the ambulance and she told me to shut up or she was gonna shove something in my throat. I passed out and ended up going into... I went to a couple different hospitals because one was closer. They sent me to Oregon Science and Health University, Health and Science University.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And that is when I fell into a non-medically induced coma from all the strokes. And immediately though, as soon as I started going into strokes, I started falling down like downward into hell. And I had on each side of me six demons, and they were literally shredding and pulling my skin to try to get me to hell because they would be rewarded. They were even stretching their own being to get me there.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And then in the meantime, I'd be thrown into these realms that were really strange but like demonic, just horribly tortured. And then all of a sudden, it seemed like when they were done with me there, they would throw me out and it was blacker than black. And I knew it because you could feel it, the evil.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And so I researched that as soon as I came back and it was surely the outer darkness. And a darkness... It says in the Bible a darkness you can feel. And to my right there was a being there and he was incredibly... You just knew he was Satan. And I remember as I'd be thrown in and out of these realms not even trying to look at him but you can't help it because when you're out of your body you have a 360-degree view of yourself, of the creatures of everything.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So I saw this being and he just looked horrible. He had this body of a lamb with fur that like glue like slime was gluing it together. And he had a black black wolf face and he had these piercing red beam eyes. And he would sit there and he would just whisper to the demons over and over just get her down here she'll never know she doesn't belong.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And that was true because on my descent I had forgot about God even. I was being horrifically tortured and I just didn't... I don't know why other than for him to share his glory of keeping us even when we don't even acknowledge him he keeps his promises to us.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>But on my third realm that I was thrown out of sinking down even further I knew I was right above hell... Hell instinctively. And at that moment I said I guess I'm going to hell. And as soon as I said that this huge being comes above us we could sense his presence. He comes above us; I go like that with the demons pulling on the sides of my arm still and trying to get me to hell.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And right then this being spreads his legs in a stance and puts his arms across his chest and said "I don't think so," looking down. And as he said that I'll never forget...I was looking up because we just heard this voice...I looked down and all the demons are gone by the first syllable. And I just thought that was incredible.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And then he grabs me; he reaches down; he grabs me; picks me up. And I remember straight up not seeing his face yet but straight up going back into my body. And now I realized that I didn't see his face because I wasn't transformed.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So I just knew he had more power than anything ever and that he was good. And I get into my bed in the hospital and hear all the machines and stuff...and yeah it was just incredible.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Do you have an idea Camille who this was? Was this the Lord? Was it an angel? Who was that?

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So the demons were trying to trick you basically into getting you before God intervened...and obviously they couldn't do that...and now you're going to the opposite place?

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Yes yes...So I'm back into my body...and I remember looking up at the hospital tiles and saying what's going on where am I? And then I heard all the beeping of the machines...and I said to myself oh I'm in the hospital...Well just then the ceiling tiles turned into total clouds...just covered in clouds...and his mighty right hand reached out and pulls out my soul.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

            <p>And my hair was long then but it was... it's hard to measure exactly how much...but it was just like a tenth to a quarter of his length of his...just his thumbnail. And then I went...I got eternity first of all...it just slammed me in the face...because you get it when you're out of your body and it's scary.

            <p>And then I knew that the being holding me had all the power...I knew that...I remember thinking I had all this power on earth but wherever this being wants me to go I'm going.

            <p>And then he takes me...and fortunately I was saved...and he throws me up like an arrow into the sky...and my arms flew in front of me...and I had an angel on each side cusp..excuse me each side of my elbow...and I remember trying to see them but all I could see are the white robes with the gold accents...and I remember just flying through outer space...and I kept trying to see their faces but they were so mighty and tall.

            <p>And Camille's here, Camille's here, and the hundreds were gathering, and God told me, or I remember saying, how could I have affected that many people on earth? And I don't know if that was a future thing or I don't know. But all these people were gathering, and then at the very back of the line, I saw this little boy. And I think because he would have been about three there, two and a half, three. So, and I also had had visions of him since not crawling, you know, hopping over his Tigers and stuff. I'll get to that, but he was crawling at the very back. And I said, who is, and God always answered my question by the second or third word, and he said, well Camille, that's your son.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>I had lost a baby in 2010 by miscarriage; it's always hard for me to talk about, but at four and a half months. I had no idea what the sex was because I didn't know I was pregnant. I just knew when I miscarried that I lost the baby. Because it happened, he looked about what age to me? About two to maybe a little older because he had real long big hair like his mom. Just like me, yeah, big curl curly hair. Yeah, and I just knew he looked so much like me, like I saw pictures of me at four, three or four, and it looked exactly the same hair.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And then he also graced me with seeing my daughter because I had also lost a baby too in 1989 in my first marriage. She would go, and it was so funny because I thought there wasn't mourning in heaven. But I knew God told me that every morning she would run and play with butterflies and hummingbirds. Then I read in scripture more about the mourning in heaven. And I was like, wow, just so many things happen that I could never ever have made up. There are just no incredible things like Him knowing every word before it hits my tongue. So many things, dozens of scriptures now.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>The most interesting part to me and the grace-given part to me was when I was sitting on the steps of heaven. And I was looking around, and I just couldn't believe I was there. And I just said, how can it be, and God's right up by His throne a couple of stairs ahead of me, above me. Him and God and the lion, He was just petting the lion; it was so cool. And I was looking around heaven saying how can it be that I'm here? I said I was a sinner on earth. I had sin. I hadn't confessed or sin I hadn't confessed of before I died. And He said simply as ever, it's because of the blood.

            <p>I said, but I had addictions on earth; I had things I hadn't overcome yet. And then He reaches down because He was human-looking to me, you know. And He reaches down with His big huge finger and points in my face and says make no mistake Camille; I know everyone's heart. Because even the only thing I had questioned was that I was on pain medication because of all my pain. I've been in pain for a couple of years honestly because of the infections I kept getting. The mold would cause me to have bubbly rashes that would break and itch, then it became a blood infection.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So that blood infection got onto my pacemaker, and the wires went directly into my heart causing the heart failure. So I was in a horrific amount of pain, but I would cry to the Lord because I thought that any kind of anything we did to ease pain other than God could send us to hell. And that's just not true. God wants us to be taken care of as well. It's different because I am a full believer in 1st Corinthians 6:9-10 of willfully sinning and fornicating and being drunkard. You can't be do those things and inherit the kingdom of God. So I'm not at all saying that but at the same time He understands what we're going through as well.

            <p>Yes, we got to be so careful about that; now I'm so careful about that. But there are so many amazing things I saw that honestly, last night at church praying sobbing because I can't believe He gave me all these revelations. And I told Him that the other night and said why would you give someone like me who still falls? I'm not perfect by any means; none of us can be. Why would you give me that? I don't deserve that and He just said that's why.

            <p>I remember when He told me He had to come back. It was mixed up with the "Are you having fun yet?" comment, then He goes cuz now you got to go back. I saw this crystal heart shatter on the floor—there's this song by Hillsong called "Broken Vessel"—I listened to it the other day and cried because it reminded me of that moment—it said pieces shattered on the floor—amazing grace is also what it's called.
