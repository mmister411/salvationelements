And he had a black, black wolf face and he had these piercing red beam eyes. And I saw this huge lion and this lion had eyes of fire and he had white fur with the tips appeared to be drenched in blood. And that was always the words I used since I came back.

Welcome to this episode of Heaven Encounters. My guest today, Camille Hall, suffered from cardiac disease for most of her life from early childhood. That led to cardiac arrest after she was told that if she didn't have a heart transplant within a period of time that she would die. And indeed she suffered from a cardiac arrest, experienced something very hellish, but she'll take us to heaven today. And this is gonna be absolutely amazing. So Camille, great to be with you today.
        Copy



Hi, Randy, it's so great to be here. Thank you.
        Copy



Well, Camille, you did suffer through most of your childhood and tell us about how that led up to your afterlife experience.
        Copy



Sure. So in all my life, I've suffered with heart disease, so congenital heart disease. And so I just kind of had dealt with that, different things on and off. And I got a pacemaker when I was 18 and just have always dealt with things. But then in 2009, I ended up moving into a house that was full of toxic mold. And it's not the regular black mold that people see, so I like to not scare anybody by that, but we had it tested because it looked different. So we had it tested. And in fact, it was the 1% most harmful kind of mold.
        Copy



And I had started, but before we knew that, this was a year after I came back from the hospital, but before we knew that, I became really ill. And my heart, just on a regular checkups, they said it was basically blowing up. It was, I had a huge enlarged heart, like it was growing rapidly, and they gave me a year to live without a heart transplant. At that time, that was August of 2012, I went home and God said, pray like you never have before because you don't want someone else's heart.
        Copy



And I was just stunned by that. So I just prayed and prayed, and I honestly thought I was gonna die because they had told me that at the hospital. They said to get grief counselors for my family and prepare. And so I just started getting closer and closer to the Lord. I was already saved, thankfully, but that really showed me a lot.
        Copy



But then I got really sick. March of 2013, I was at my house, and for about three days, I ended up having just complete body aches and swelling, like you couldn't believe, like the swelling. I always say edema is probably the most underrated pain we have, and this horrible pain. And on the third day, I just, I remember, I'll just be quite frank, I remember urinating blood. And I looked down, I saw that, and then I got dizzy. And then I said, call 911 to my husband at the time, right then, for the first time in my life, I'd ever said that. And then I went into strokes.
        Copy



But I remember this lady coming to the house, and she was, I'll never forget it because she was so extremely demonic. And she told my husband to leave me there and to go in Monday because this was a Saturday. And I remember going, trying to struggle to say, no, no. But fortunately, he said, you're taking her in.
        Copy



And then we got into the ambulance and she told me to shut up or she was gonna shove something in my throat. I passed out and ended up going into... I went to a couple different hospitals because one was closer. They sent me to Oregon Science and Health University, Health and Science University.
        Copy



And that is when I fell into a non-medically induced coma from all the strokes. And immediately though, as soon as I started going into strokes, I started falling down like downward into hell. And I had on each side of me six demons, and they were literally shredding and pulling my skin to try to get me to hell because they would be rewarded. They were even stretching their own being to get me there.
        Copy



And then in the meantime, I'd be thrown into these realms that were really strange but like demonic, just horribly tortured. And then all of a sudden, it seemed like when they were done with me there, they would throw me out and it was blacker than black. And I knew it because you could feel it, the evil.
        Copy



And so I researched that as soon as I came back and it was surely the outer darkness. And a darkness... It says in the Bible a darkness you can feel. And to my right there was a being there and he was incredibly... You just knew he was Satan. And I remember as I'd be thrown in and out of these realms not even trying to look at him but you can't help it because when you're out of your body you have a 360-degree view of yourself, of the creatures of everything.
        Copy



So I saw this being and he just looked horrible. He had this body of a lamb with fur that like glue like slime was gluing it together. And he had a black black wolf face and he had these piercing red beam eyes. And he would sit there and he would just whisper to the demons over and over just get her down here she'll never know she doesn't belong.
        Copy



And that was true because on my descent I had forgot about God even. I was being horrifically tortured and I just didn't... I don't know why other than for him to share his glory of keeping us even when we don't even acknowledge him he keeps his promises to us.
        Copy



But on my third realm that I was thrown out of sinking down even further I knew I was right above hell... Hell instinctively. And at that moment I said I guess I'm going to hell. And as soon as I said that this huge being comes above us we could sense his presence. He comes above us; I go like that with the demons pulling on the sides of my arm still and trying to get me to hell.
        Copy



And right then this being spreads his legs in a stance and puts his arms across his chest and said "I don't think so," looking down. And as he said that I'll never forget...I was looking up because we just heard this voice...I looked down and all the demons are gone by the first syllable. And I just thought that was incredible.
        Copy



And then he grabs me; he reaches down; he grabs me; picks me up. And I remember straight up not seeing his face yet but straight up going back into my body. And now I realized that I didn't see his face because I wasn't transformed.
        Copy



So I just knew he had more power than anything ever and that he was good. And I get into my bed in the hospital and hear all the machines and stuff...and yeah it was just incredible.
        Copy



And then...
        Copy



Do you have an idea Camille who this was? Was this the Lord? Was it an angel? Who was that?
        Copy



It was God himself.
        Copy



That rescued you?
        Copy



God himself... God himself yeah.
        Copy



So the demons were trying to trick you basically into getting you before God intervened...and obviously they couldn't do that...and now you're going to the opposite place?
        Copy



Yes yes...So I'm back into my body...and I remember looking up at the hospital tiles and saying what's going on where am I? And then I heard all the beeping of the machines...and I said to myself oh I'm in the hospital...Well just then the ceiling tiles turned into total clouds...just covered in clouds...and his mighty right hand reached out and pulls out my soul.
        Copy



And my hair was long then but it was... it's hard to measure exactly how much...but it was just like a tenth to a quarter of his length of his...just his thumbnail. And then I went...I got eternity first of all...it just slammed me in the face...because you get it when you're out of your body and it's scary.
        Copy



And then I knew that the being holding me had all the power...I knew that...I remember thinking I had all this power on earth but wherever this being wants me to go I'm going.
        Copy



And then he takes me...and fortunately I was saved...and he throws me up like an arrow into the sky...and my arms flew in front of me...and I had an angel on each side cusp..excuse me each side of my elbow...and I remember trying to see them but all I could see are the white robes with the gold accents...and I remember just flying through outer space...and I kept trying to see their faces but they were so mighty and tall.
        Copy



And I got to see all the planets and everything...and then they dropped me off and I went whoa where are they? Because I wanted to see them so bad..and they just disappeared...and then as soon as they left me alone there...
        Copy



I just knew I was under a city or a place...and right at that moment...I start transforming..I start going upward..I can only describe it as like an elevator going upward because it went from head..to the top of my head..to the bottom of my feet..I was completely transformed...
        Copy



And then I got there..and I'll remember looking at the floor..the tile..it appeared to be like tile...but it had all these materials..and ivory..I know ivory was in a lot of things even God's throne...
        Copy



I remember going what's going on what's going on? And then..I heard God's voice the first time..and he just says simply you no longer have to fear..
        Copy



And then at that moment that's when it all hit me..the perfection like where my energy..that was a huge one because I've always struggled with energy..with my heart condition..and that will always be the most powerful part to me as far as the way I felt..was all the perfect energy..and just feeling completely enveloped in love..and health..and all the things we can't even imagine here...
        Copy



And as soon as felt that way..the Lord or God said to me....you have a form and it is perfect..
        Copy



And then..I started running in place because..I was so excited...that could run and..felt so good....
        Copy



And then as soon as started running in place....I literally.....my feet went off ground....and....went around heaven’s gates four times....
        Copy



And....knew four times....because when came back....could draw how many times.....was doing....
        Copy



It....was four....counted four....but......it.....was like light.....like tracers....of light followed around.....
        Copy



It......just so incredible....
        Copy



And yeah.....then started.......stand there......after........got done doing......just going......
        Copy



And then.....got asked if......was having fun yet.......it's all simultaneous time.......so....kind hard.....describe exactly order......
        Copy
