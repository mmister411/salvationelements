0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.279,3.2799999713897705," So I saw this being, he just looked horrible."
1,00:00:03.279,00:00:06.840,3.56000018119812," He had this body of a lamb with fur that like glue,"
2,00:00:06.840,00:00:09.560,2.7200002670288086, like slime was gluing it together.
3,00:00:09.560,00:00:12.680,3.119999885559082," And he had a black, black wolf face"
4,00:00:12.680,00:00:15.880,3.1999998092651367, and he had these piercing red beam eyes.
5,00:00:15.880,00:00:20.319,4.439999580383301, And I saw this huge lion and this lion had eyes of fire
6,00:00:20.319,00:00:22.719,2.3999996185302734, and he had white fur with the tips
7,00:00:22.719,00:00:24.399,1.6800003051757812, appeared to be drenched in blood.
8,00:00:24.399,00:00:27.920,3.520000457763672, And that was always the words I used since I came back.

10,00:00:32.920,00:00:35.120,2.200000762939453, Welcome to this episode of Heaven Encounters.
11,00:00:35.120,00:00:37.000,1.8800010681152344," My guest today, Camille Hall,"
12,00:00:37.000,00:00:39.320,2.3199996948242188, suffered from cardiac disease
13,00:00:39.320,00:00:42.399,3.079998016357422, for most of her life from early childhood.
14,00:00:42.399,00:00:46.800,4.400001525878906, That led to cardiac arrest after she was told
15,00:00:46.800,00:00:49.519,2.7199974060058594, that if she didn't have a heart transplant
16,00:00:49.519,00:00:52.079,2.5600013732910156, within a period of time that she would die.
17,00:00:52.079,00:00:54.880,2.8000030517578125," And indeed she suffered from a cardiac arrest,"
18,00:00:54.880,00:00:57.679,2.7999954223632812," experienced something very hellish,"
19,00:00:57.679,00:01:00.240,2.5600051879882812, but she'll take us to heaven today.
20,00:01:00.240,00:01:02.120,1.8799972534179688, And this is gonna be absolutely amazing.
21,00:01:02.120,00:01:04.279,2.1599960327148438," So Camille, great to be with you today."
22,00:01:04.279,00:01:06.160,1.8800048828125," Hi, Randy, it's so great to be here."
23,00:01:06.160,00:01:06.999,0.839996337890625, Thank you.
24,00:01:06.999,00:01:10.480,3.4800033569335938," Well, Camille, you did suffer through most of your childhood"
25,00:01:10.480,00:01:13.440,2.9599990844726562, and tell us about how that led up
26,00:01:13.440,00:01:18.079,4.6399993896484375, to your afterlife experience.
27,00:01:18.079,00:01:18.920,0.8400039672851562, Sure.
28,00:01:18.920,00:01:23.440,4.519996643066406," So in all my life, I've suffered with heart disease,"
29,00:01:23.440,00:01:26.679,3.2399978637695312, so congenital heart disease.
30,00:01:26.679,00:01:29.719,3.0400009155273438," And so I just kind of had dealt with that,"
31,00:01:29.719,00:01:31.240,1.5200042724609375, different things on and off.
32,00:01:31.240,00:01:33.560,2.3199996948242188, And I got a pacemaker when I was 18
33,00:01:33.560,00:01:36.440,2.8799972534179688, and just have always dealt with things.
34,00:01:36.440,00:01:41.200,4.760002136230469," But then in 2009, I ended up moving into a house"
35,00:01:41.200,00:01:43.280,2.0800018310546875, that was full of toxic mold.
36,00:01:43.280,00:01:45.840,2.55999755859375," And it's not the regular black mold that people see,"
37,00:01:45.840,00:01:48.160,2.3199996948242188," so I like to not scare anybody by that,"
38,00:01:48.160,00:01:51.280,3.1200027465820312, but we had it tested because it looked different.
39,00:01:51.280,00:01:52.600,1.3199996948242188, So we had it tested.
40,00:01:52.600,00:01:57.359,4.7599945068359375," And in fact, it was the 1% most harmful kind of mold."
41,00:01:57.359,00:02:01.280,3.920013427734375," And I had started, but before we knew that,"
42,00:02:01.280,00:02:03.999,2.7199859619140625," this was a year after I came back from the hospital,"
43,00:02:03.999,00:02:07.320,3.32000732421875," but before we knew that, I became really ill."
44,00:02:07.320,00:02:10.560,3.2400054931640625," And my heart, just on a regular checkups,"
45,00:02:10.560,00:02:12.680,2.1199951171875, they said it was basically blowing up.
46,00:02:12.680,00:02:15.320,2.6399993896484375," It was, I had a huge enlarged heart,"
47,00:02:15.320,00:02:16.960,1.6399993896484375," like it was growing rapidly,"
48,00:02:16.960,00:02:20.520,3.55999755859375, and they gave me a year to live without a heart transplant.
49,00:02:20.520,00:02:24.120,3.600006103515625," At that time, that was August of 2012,"
50,00:02:24.120,00:02:27.400,3.279998779296875," I went home and God said, pray like you never have before"
51,00:02:27.400,00:02:30.079,2.67999267578125, because you don't want someone else's heart.
52,00:02:30.079,00:02:32.280,2.20001220703125, And I was just stunned by that.
53,00:02:32.280,00:02:34.120,1.839996337890625," So I just prayed and prayed,"
54,00:02:34.120,00:02:36.760,2.6399993896484375, and I honestly thought I was gonna die
55,00:02:36.760,00:02:38.680,1.9199981689453125, because they had told me that at the hospital.
56,00:02:38.680,00:02:43.680,5.0, They said to get grief counselors for my family and prepare.
57,00:02:43.680,00:02:46.800,3.1199951171875, And so I just started getting closer and closer to the Lord.
58,00:02:46.800,00:02:48.919,2.1199951171875," I was already saved, thankfully,"
59,00:02:48.919,00:02:50.639,1.720001220703125, but that really showed me a lot.
60,00:02:50.639,00:02:53.359,2.720001220703125, But then I got really sick.
61,00:02:53.359,00:02:55.999,2.6399993896484375," March of 2013, I was at my house,"
62,00:02:55.999,00:02:57.839,1.839996337890625," and for about three days,"
63,00:02:57.839,00:03:02.719,4.8800048828125," I ended up having just complete body aches and swelling,"
64,00:03:02.719,00:03:04.960,2.2400054931640625," like you couldn't believe, like the swelling."
65,00:03:04.960,00:03:06.800,1.839996337890625, I always say edema is probably
66,00:03:06.800,00:03:09.760,2.9600067138671875," the most underrated pain we have,"
67,00:03:09.760,00:03:12.639,2.8799896240234375, and this horrible pain.
68,00:03:12.639,00:03:16.719,4.0800018310546875," And on the third day, I just,"
69,00:03:16.719,00:03:18.400,1.6800079345703125," I remember, I'll just be quite frank,"
70,00:03:18.400,00:03:20.680,2.279998779296875, I remember urinating blood.
71,00:03:20.680,00:03:23.359,2.67999267578125," And I looked down, I saw that,"
72,00:03:23.359,00:03:24.600,1.2400054931640625, and then I got dizzy.
73,00:03:24.600,00:03:29.040,4.44000244140625," And then I said, call 911 to my husband at the time,"
74,00:03:29.040,00:03:31.079,2.0399932861328125," right then, for the first time in my life,"
75,00:03:31.079,00:03:32.600,1.5200042724609375, I'd ever said that.
76,00:03:32.600,00:03:35.320,2.720001220703125, And then I went into strokes.
77,00:03:35.320,00:03:38.320,3.0," But I remember this lady coming to the house,"
78,00:03:38.320,00:03:40.279,1.959991455078125," and she was, I'll never forget it,"
79,00:03:40.279,00:03:43.079,2.8000030517578125, because she was so extremely demonic.
80,00:03:43.079,00:03:46.079,3.0, And she told my husband to leave me there
81,00:03:46.079,00:03:49.199,3.1199951171875," and to go in Monday, because this was a Saturday."
82,00:03:49.199,00:03:52.800,3.600006103515625," And I remember going, trying to struggle to say, no, no."
83,00:03:52.800,00:03:55.600,2.8000030517578125," But fortunately, he said, you're taking her in."
84,00:03:55.600,00:03:57.440,1.839996337890625, And then we got into the ambulance
85,00:03:57.440,00:03:58.600,1.160003662109375," and she told me to shut up,"
86,00:03:58.600,00:04:01.040,2.44000244140625, or she was gonna shove something in my throat.
87,00:04:01.040,00:04:04.919,3.8799896240234375," I passed out and ended up going into,"
88,00:04:04.919,00:04:06.520,1.600006103515625," I went to a couple different hospitals,"
89,00:04:06.520,00:04:07.720,1.20001220703125, because one was closer.
90,00:04:07.720,00:04:10.159,2.439971923828125," They sent me to Oregon Science and Health University,"
91,00:04:10.159,00:04:11.720,1.560028076171875, Health and Science University.
92,00:04:11.720,00:04:16.720,5.0, And that is when I fell into a non-medically induced coma
93,00:04:16.720,00:04:18.280,1.55999755859375, from all the strokes.
94,00:04:18.280,00:04:20.919,2.639984130859375," And immediately though,"
95,00:04:20.919,00:04:23.240,2.32000732421875," as soon as I started going into strokes,"
96,00:04:23.240,00:04:26.919,3.67999267578125," I started falling down, like downward into hell."
97,00:04:26.919,00:04:30.880,3.96002197265625," And I had on each side of me, six demons,"
98,00:04:30.880,00:04:33.800,2.91998291015625, and they were literally shredding and pulling my skin
99,00:04:33.800,00:04:36.400,2.600006103515625," to try to get me to hell, because they would be rewarded."
100,00:04:36.400,00:04:39.960,3.55999755859375, They were even stretching their own being to get me there.
101,00:04:39.960,00:04:42.320,2.360015869140625," And then in the meantime,"
102,00:04:42.320,00:04:45.079,2.759979248046875," I'd be thrown into these realms that were really strange,"
103,00:04:45.079,00:04:49.320,4.240020751953125," but like demonic, just horribly tortured."
104,00:04:49.320,00:04:51.000,1.67999267578125," And then all of a sudden,"
105,00:04:51.000,00:04:53.400,2.399993896484375," it seemed like when they were done with me there,"
106,00:04:53.400,00:04:56.759,3.3599853515625, they would throw me out and it was blacker than black.
107,00:04:56.759,00:05:00.239,3.47998046875," And I knew it, because you could feel it, the evil."
108,00:05:00.239,00:05:02.799,2.55999755859375," And so I researched that as soon as I came back,"
109,00:05:02.799,00:05:05.479,2.680023193359375, and it was surely the outer darkness.
110,00:05:05.479,00:05:08.279,2.79998779296875," And a darkness, it says in the Bible,"
111,00:05:08.279,00:05:10.079,1.79998779296875, a darkness you can feel.
112,00:05:10.079,00:05:13.319,3.240020751953125," And to my right, there was a being there,"
113,00:05:13.319,00:05:17.519,4.199981689453125," and he was incredibly, you just knew he was Satan."
114,00:05:17.519,00:05:20.079,2.55999755859375," And I remember as I'd be thrown in and out of these realms,"
115,00:05:20.079,00:05:23.279,3.20001220703125," not even trying to look at him, but you can't help it,"
116,00:05:23.279,00:05:24.639,1.3599853515625," because when you're out of your body,"
117,00:05:24.639,00:05:27.599,2.96002197265625," you have a 360 degree view of yourself,"
118,00:05:27.599,00:05:30.759,3.160003662109375," of the creatures, of everything."
119,00:05:30.759,00:05:35.079,4.319976806640625," So I saw this being, and he just looked horrible."
120,00:05:35.079,00:05:38.599,3.52001953125," He had this body of a lamb with fur that like glue,"
121,00:05:38.599,00:05:41.759,3.160003662109375, like slime was gluing it together.
122,00:05:41.759,00:05:45.679,3.91998291015625," And he had a black, black wolf face,"
123,00:05:45.679,00:05:49.199,3.52001953125, and he had these piercing red beam eyes.
124,00:05:49.199,00:05:50.319,1.1199951171875, And he would sit there
125,00:05:50.319,00:05:53.359,3.03997802734375," and he would just whisper to the demons over and over,"
126,00:05:53.359,00:05:54.479,1.1199951171875," just get her down here,"
127,00:05:54.479,00:05:56.719,2.240020751953125, she'll never know she doesn't belong.
128,00:05:56.719,00:05:59.599,2.879974365234375," And that was true, because on my descent,"
129,00:05:59.599,00:06:01.879,2.279998779296875, I had forgot about God even.
130,00:06:01.879,00:06:05.359,3.480010986328125," I was being horrifically tortured, and I just didn't,"
131,00:06:05.359,00:06:09.039,3.67999267578125, I don't know why other than for him to share his glory
132,00:06:09.039,00:06:13.039,4.0," of keeping us, even when we don't even acknowledge him,"
133,00:06:13.039,00:06:15.559,2.52001953125, he keeps his promises to us.
134,00:06:15.559,00:06:18.879,3.319976806640625," But on my third realm that I was thrown out of,"
135,00:06:18.879,00:06:20.239,1.360015869140625," sinking down even further,"
136,00:06:20.239,00:06:24.279,4.03997802734375," I knew I was right above hell, hell instinctively."
137,00:06:24.279,00:06:27.759,3.480010986328125," And at that moment, I said, I guess I'm going to hell."
138,00:06:27.759,00:06:31.879,4.1199951171875," And as soon as I said that, this huge being comes above us,"
139,00:06:31.879,00:06:33.919,2.040008544921875, we could sense his presence.
140,00:06:33.919,00:06:35.959,2.040008544921875," He comes above us, I go like that,"
141,00:06:35.959,00:06:39.039,3.079986572265625," with the demons pulling on the sides of my arm still,"
142,00:06:39.039,00:06:40.279,1.239990234375, and trying to get me to hell.
143,00:06:40.279,00:06:44.799,4.52001953125," And right then, this being spreads his legs in a stance"
144,00:06:44.799,00:06:48.319,3.519989013671875," and puts his arms across his chest and said,"
145,00:06:48.319,00:06:50.639,2.32000732421875," I don't think so, looking down."
146,00:06:50.639,00:06:53.159,2.519989013671875," And as he said that, I'll never forget,"
147,00:06:53.159,00:06:55.799,2.639984130859375, I was looking up because we just heard this voice.
148,00:06:55.799,00:06:58.279,2.480010986328125, I looked down and all the demons are gone
149,00:06:58.279,00:07:00.159,1.8800048828125, by the first syllable.
150,00:07:00.159,00:07:02.679,2.519989013671875, And I just thought that was incredible.
151,00:07:02.679,00:07:05.359,2.680023193359375," And then he grabs me, he reaches down,"
152,00:07:05.359,00:07:07.239,1.879974365234375," he grabs me, picks me up."
153,00:07:07.239,00:07:10.759,3.52001953125," And I remember straight up not seeing his face yet,"
154,00:07:10.759,00:07:14.079,3.32000732421875, but straight up going back into my body.
155,00:07:14.079,00:07:17.039,2.959991455078125, And now I realized that I didn't see his face
156,00:07:17.039,00:07:19.079,2.040008544921875, because I wasn't transformed.
157,00:07:19.079,00:07:22.839,3.759979248046875," So I just knew he had more power than anything ever,"
158,00:07:22.839,00:07:24.679,1.839996337890625, and that he was good.
159,00:07:24.679,00:07:28.399,3.720001220703125, And I get into my bed in the hospital
160,00:07:28.399,00:07:30.799,2.399993896484375, and hear all the machines and stuff.
161,00:07:30.799,00:07:33.079,2.280029296875," And yeah, it was just incredible."
162,00:07:33.079,00:07:33.919,0.839996337890625, And then-
163,00:07:33.919,00:07:37.239,3.319976806640625," Do you have an idea, Camille, who this was?"
164,00:07:37.239,00:07:38.239,1.0, Was this the Lord?
165,00:07:38.239,00:07:39.839,1.600006103515625, Was it an angel?
166,00:07:39.839,00:07:40.679,0.839996337890625, Who was that?
167,00:07:40.679,00:07:41.519,0.839996337890625, It was God himself.
168,00:07:41.519,00:07:42.359,0.84002685546875, That rescued you.
169,00:07:42.359,00:07:43.199,0.839996337890625, God himself.
170,00:07:43.199,00:07:44.039,0.839996337890625," God himself, yeah."
171,00:07:44.039,00:07:46.559,2.519989013671875, So the demons were trying to trick you.
172,00:07:46.559,00:07:50.479,3.91998291015625, Basically into getting you before God intervened.
173,00:07:50.479,00:07:52.999,2.52001953125, And obviously they couldn't do that.
174,00:07:52.999,00:07:56.839,3.839996337890625, And now you're going to the opposite place.
175,00:07:56.839,00:07:58.119,1.279998779296875," Yes, yes."
176,00:07:58.119,00:08:00.199,2.079986572265625, So I'm back into my body.
177,00:08:00.199,00:08:02.919,2.720001220703125, And I remember looking up at the hospital tiles
178,00:08:02.919,00:08:04.399,1.480010986328125," and saying, what's going on?"
179,00:08:04.399,00:08:05.239,0.839996337890625, Where am I?
180,00:08:05.239,00:08:07.719,2.480010986328125, And then I heard all the beeping of the machines.
181,00:08:07.719,00:08:10.479,2.759979248046875," And I said to myself, oh, I'm in the hospital."
182,00:08:10.479,00:08:15.119,4.6400146484375," Well, just then the ceiling tiles turned into total clouds,"
183,00:08:15.119,00:08:16.759,1.6400146484375, just covered in clouds.
184,00:08:16.759,00:08:19.879,3.1199951171875, And his mighty right hand reached out
185,00:08:19.879,00:08:21.639,1.760009765625, and pulls out my soul.
186,00:08:21.639,00:08:24.039,2.39996337890625," And my hair was long then,"
187,00:08:24.039,00:08:26.959,2.9200439453125," but it was, it's hard to measure exactly how much,"
188,00:08:26.959,00:08:29.159,2.199951171875, but it was just like a tenth to a quarter
189,00:08:29.159,00:08:32.159,3.0," of his length of his, just his thumbnail."
190,00:08:32.159,00:08:36.399,4.239990234375," And then I went, I got eternity, first of all."
191,00:08:36.399,00:08:38.479,2.08001708984375, It just slammed me in the face.
192,00:08:38.479,00:08:40.159,1.67999267578125, Because you get it when you're out of your body
193,00:08:40.159,00:08:41.599,1.44000244140625, and it's scary.
194,00:08:41.599,00:08:46.599,5.0, And then I knew that the being holding me had all the power.
195,00:08:46.599,00:08:48.719,2.1199951171875," I knew that, I remember thinking"
196,00:08:48.719,00:08:50.159,1.44000244140625," I had all this power on earth,"
197,00:08:50.159,00:08:52.839,2.67999267578125," but wherever this being wants me to go, I'm going."
198,00:08:52.839,00:08:56.559,3.72003173828125," And then he takes me, and fortunately I was saved."
199,00:08:56.559,00:09:00.359,3.79998779296875, And he throws me up like an arrow into the sky.
200,00:09:00.359,00:09:03.119,2.760009765625, And I have my arms flew in front of me.
201,00:09:03.119,00:09:05.479,2.3599853515625," And I had an angel on each side,"
202,00:09:05.479,00:09:08.959,3.47998046875," cusp, excuse me, each side of my elbow."
203,00:09:08.959,00:09:10.359,1.4000244140625," And I remember trying to see them,"
204,00:09:10.359,00:09:12.159,1.79998779296875, but all I could see are the white robes
205,00:09:12.159,00:09:13.839,1.67999267578125, with the gold accents.
206,00:09:13.839,00:09:16.839,3.0, And I remember just flying through outer space.
207,00:09:16.839,00:09:18.759,1.91998291015625," And I kept trying to see their faces,"
208,00:09:18.759,00:09:21.119,2.36004638671875, but they were so mighty and tall.
209,00:09:21.119,00:09:24.799,3.67999267578125, And I got to see all the planets and everything.
210,00:09:24.799,00:09:27.439,2.63995361328125," And then they dropped me off and I went,"
211,00:09:27.439,00:09:28.599,1.1600341796875," whoa, where are they?"
212,00:09:28.599,00:09:30.799,2.20001220703125, Because I wanted to see them so bad.
213,00:09:30.799,00:09:34.479,3.67999267578125, And they just disappeared.
214,00:09:34.479,00:09:38.159,3.67999267578125," And then as soon as they left me alone there,"
215,00:09:38.159,00:09:40.839,2.6800537109375, I just knew I was under a city or a place.
216,00:09:40.839,00:09:43.319,2.47998046875," And right at that moment, I start transforming."
217,00:09:43.319,00:09:44.679,1.3599853515625, I start going upward.
218,00:09:44.679,00:09:48.039,3.3599853515625, I can only describe it as like an elevator going upward
219,00:09:48.039,00:09:51.439,3.4000244140625, because it went from head to the top of my head
220,00:09:51.439,00:09:52.799,1.3599853515625, to the bottom of my feet.
221,00:09:52.799,00:09:55.199,2.4000244140625, I was completely transformed.
222,00:09:55.199,00:09:58.079,2.8800048828125," And then I got there and I remember looking at the floor,"
223,00:09:58.079,00:10:01.079,3.0," the tile, it appeared to be like tile,"
224,00:10:01.079,00:10:03.919,2.8399658203125, but it had all these materials and ivory.
225,00:10:03.919,00:10:06.799,2.8800048828125," I know ivory was in a lot of things, even God's throne."
226,00:10:06.799,00:10:08.759,1.96002197265625," I remember going, what's going on?"
227,00:10:08.759,00:10:09.599,0.8399658203125, What's going on?
228,00:10:09.599,00:10:12.159,2.55999755859375, And then I heard God's voice the first time.
229,00:10:12.159,00:10:15.439,3.280029296875," And he just says, simply, you no longer have to fear."
230,00:10:15.439,00:10:17.439,2.0," And then at that moment,"
231,00:10:17.439,00:10:20.519,3.0799560546875," that's when it all hit me, the perfection,"
232,00:10:20.519,00:10:23.919,3.4000244140625," like where my energy, that was a huge one"
233,00:10:23.919,00:10:25.519,1.5999755859375," because I've always struggled with energy,"
234,00:10:25.519,00:10:27.119,1.60003662109375, with my heart condition.
235,00:10:27.119,00:10:31.759,4.63995361328125, And that will always be the most powerful part to me
236,00:10:31.759,00:10:35.519,3.760009765625, as far as the way I felt was all the perfect energy
237,00:10:35.519,00:10:39.719,4.20001220703125, and just feeling completely enveloped in love and health
238,00:10:39.719,00:10:43.159,3.44000244140625, and all the things we can't even imagine here.
239,00:10:43.159,00:10:46.879,3.72003173828125," And as soon as I felt that way, the Lord or God said to me,"
240,00:10:46.879,00:10:49.399,2.51995849609375, you have a form and it is perfect.
241,00:10:49.399,00:10:52.439,3.0400390625, And then I started running in place
242,00:10:52.439,00:10:54.359,1.91998291015625, because I was so excited that I could run
243,00:10:54.359,00:10:56.759,2.39996337890625, and that I felt so good.
244,00:10:56.759,00:10:58.959,2.20001220703125," And then as soon as I started running in place,"
245,00:10:58.959,00:11:01.919,2.96002197265625," I literally, my feet went off the ground"
246,00:11:01.919,00:11:04.439,2.52001953125, and I went around heaven's gates four times.
247,00:11:04.439,00:11:08.079,3.63995361328125," And I knew it was four times because when I came back,"
248,00:11:08.079,00:11:11.919,3.84002685546875, I could draw how many times I was doing it.
249,00:11:11.919,00:11:14.119,2.20001220703125," And it was four, I counted four,"
250,00:11:14.119,00:11:15.599,1.47998046875," but it was like light,"
251,00:11:15.599,00:11:19.239,3.6400146484375, like tracers of light followed me around.
252,00:11:19.239,00:11:21.079,1.8399658203125, And it was just so incredible.
253,00:11:21.079,00:11:24.839,3.760009765625," And yeah, and then I started to stand there"
254,00:11:24.839,00:11:27.159,2.32000732421875," and after I got done doing that, just going, whew."
255,00:11:27.159,00:11:31.039,3.8800048828125, And then I got asked if I was having fun yet.
256,00:11:31.039,00:11:34.119,3.08001708984375, And it's all simultaneous time.
257,00:11:34.119,00:11:38.599,4.47998046875," So it's kind of hard to describe exactly in order,"
258,00:11:38.599,00:11:43.599,5.0, but I just remembered looking to my right as well
259,00:11:43.599,00:11:48.599,5.0, and I saw this huge lion and this lion had eyes of fire
260,00:11:48.599,00:11:50.999,2.39996337890625, and he had white fur with the tips
261,00:11:50.999,00:11:52.799,1.79998779296875, appeared to be drenched in blood.
262,00:11:52.799,00:11:56.519,3.72003173828125, And that was always the words I use since I came back
263,00:11:56.519,00:11:59.559,3.03997802734375, and the fact that he sits at a great white throne.
264,00:11:59.559,00:12:02.399,2.84002685546875, And that's why I believe along with
265,00:12:02.399,00:12:04.719,2.32000732421875," when I sat at the justice seat,"
266,00:12:04.719,00:12:06.759,2.03997802734375, cause that's what it talks about in John.
267,00:12:06.759,00:12:10.959,4.20001220703125," And that was the book that I read all this in,"
268,00:12:10.959,00:12:12.959,2.0, most of my experience in.
269,00:12:12.959,00:12:15.599,2.6400146484375, And I remember sitting at that throne
270,00:12:15.599,00:12:19.719,4.1199951171875," and seeing negatives also, I saw this twice,"
271,00:12:19.719,00:12:22.239,2.51995849609375," but the first time was how my life,"
272,00:12:22.239,00:12:26.039,3.79998779296875," everything bad that happened, everything I questioned"
273,00:12:26.039,00:12:30.079,4.0400390625," and all the good even, all worked together for my good."
274,00:12:30.079,00:12:32.479,2.39996337890625, And it brought me to that place.
275,00:12:32.479,00:12:36.439,3.96002197265625, And so I've never questioned my future
276,00:12:36.439,00:12:39.999,3.55999755859375," like I did before that, yeah."
277,00:12:39.999,00:12:40.839,0.8399658203125, And-
278,00:12:40.839,00:12:41.679,0.84002685546875, You were a perfect piece.
279,00:12:41.679,00:12:44.999,3.32000732421875," And so you were, it seems like God was taking you"
280,00:12:44.999,00:12:48.919,3.91998291015625," on a journey now of not just restoration,"
281,00:12:48.919,00:12:52.759,3.84002685546875, perfection in terms of your new body that he had given you.
282,00:12:52.759,00:12:53.599,0.8399658203125, Yeah.
283,00:12:53.599,00:12:55.839,2.239990234375," But the restoration that you would,"
284,00:12:55.839,00:12:57.599,1.760009765625, you were seeing things Camille
285,00:12:57.599,00:12:59.519,1.9200439453125, that are absolutely spectacular.
286,00:12:59.519,00:13:00.359,0.8399658203125," Yeah, yeah."
287,00:13:00.359,00:13:03.359,3.0," So I saw that lion, but what I thought there"
288,00:13:03.359,00:13:06.479,3.1199951171875, is I could fall into those eyes
289,00:13:06.479,00:13:09.479,3.0, and I would be completely content forever.
290,00:13:09.479,00:13:12.239,2.760009765625," I said, but who is the being sitting next to him?"
291,00:13:12.239,00:13:13.079,0.84002685546875, Who is that?
292,00:13:13.079,00:13:14.479,1.39996337890625, And then I knew it was God.
293,00:13:14.479,00:13:18.679,4.20001220703125," Cause once you got there, you got everything."
294,00:13:18.679,00:13:20.999,2.32000732421875," See, I always tell people that you never ask why"
295,00:13:20.999,00:13:24.519,3.51995849609375," after you die, both ways, heaven and hell."
296,00:13:24.519,00:13:27.399,2.8800048828125," You never ask why, because you get it all."
297,00:13:27.399,00:13:30.599,3.20001220703125, You get why everything happened and how
298,00:13:30.599,00:13:34.039,3.44000244140625," and you don't have to ask why, you just get it."
299,00:13:34.039,00:13:39.039,5.0, So I saw him and then Jesus was sitting right next to him.
300,00:13:39.039,00:13:41.519,2.47998046875, And I loved how they would laugh all day
301,00:13:41.519,00:13:44.319,2.800048828125, and they would just be looking down on us.
302,00:13:44.319,00:13:46.999,2.67999267578125, And I am still my same personality.
303,00:13:46.999,00:13:50.959,3.96002197265625," And I never spoke, like I have conversated with Jesus"
304,00:13:50.959,00:13:53.839,2.8800048828125, but I kidded him in God one time.
305,00:13:53.839,00:13:56.359,2.51995849609375," And I said, what are you guys laughing at?"
306,00:13:56.359,00:13:57.799,1.44000244140625, Cause I saw them looking down
307,00:13:57.799,00:14:00.719,2.9200439453125, and I knew instinctively they were looking on earth.
308,00:14:00.719,00:14:03.959,3.239990234375," And he said, I'm looking down on the ones I love."
309,00:14:03.959,00:14:06.759,2.79998779296875, And I came back and looked up the word beloved
310,00:14:06.759,00:14:09.479,2.719970703125," and sure enough, that was the ones I love."
311,00:14:09.479,00:14:13.919,4.44000244140625," And I remember looking in, I just have to share"
312,00:14:13.919,00:14:15.279,1.3599853515625," that looking in heaven's gates,"
313,00:14:15.279,00:14:19.079,3.800048828125, I saw these little angels were decorating for me
314,00:14:19.079,00:14:22.199,3.1199951171875, along the walls with my favorite colors of bows
315,00:14:22.199,00:14:25.279,3.0799560546875, and colors I didn't even know existed
316,00:14:25.279,00:14:27.559,2.280029296875, but they were already my favorite.
317,00:14:27.559,00:14:32.079,4.52001953125," It was like, God knew my spirit and just fulfilled all that."
318,00:14:32.079,00:14:34.879,2.79998779296875," And all these people, one lady was yelling."
319,00:14:34.879,00:14:42.459,7.579999923706055, And Camille's here Camille's here and the hundreds were gathering and God told me I'm or I remember saying
320,00:14:42.459,00:14:44.999,2.5399999618530273, How could I have affected that many people on earth?
321,00:14:44.999,00:14:48.839,3.8400001525878906, And I don't know if that was a future thing or I don't know
322,00:14:48.839,00:14:53.339,4.499999046325684, But all these people were gathering and then at the very back of the line
323,00:14:53.339,00:14:59.879,6.540000915527344, I saw this little boy and I think because he would have been about three there two and a half three
324,00:14:59.879,00:15:03.839,3.9599990844726562," So and I also had had visions of him since not crawling, you know"
325,00:15:03.839,00:15:06.119,2.280000686645508, Hopping over his Tigers and stuff. I'll get to that
326,00:15:06.119,00:15:11.959,5.840000152587891, but but he was crawling at the very back and I said who is and God always answered my question by the
327,00:15:11.959,00:15:15.879,3.9199981689453125," second or third word and he said well Camille, that's your son and"
328,00:15:15.879,00:15:18.479,2.5999984741210938, And he I had lost a baby in
329,00:15:18.479,00:15:20.479,2.0, 2010 by miscarriage
330,00:15:20.479,00:15:24.479,4.0, it's always hard for me to talk about but at four and a half months and
331,00:15:24.479,00:15:27.799,3.3199996948242188, I had no idea what the sex was and I could not
332,00:15:27.799,00:15:33.439,5.640003204345703, Because I didn't know I was pregnant. I just knew when I'm miscarried that I lost the baby and
333,00:15:33.439,00:15:35.679,2.2399978637695312, Because it happened he looked about what age
334,00:15:35.679,00:15:43.279,7.599998474121094, To me about two to maybe a little older because he had real long big hair like his mom
335,00:15:43.279,00:15:46.259,2.9800033569335938," Just like me yeah, yeah big curl"
336,00:15:46.259,00:15:53.179,6.9199981689453125," Curly hair. Yeah, and I just knew you know, he looked so much like me like I saw pictures me at four"
337,00:15:53.179,00:15:56.579,3.4000015258789062, three or four and it looked exactly same hair and
338,00:15:56.579,00:16:04.619,8.040000915527344," yeah, and so and then he also graced me with seeing my daughter because I had also lost a baby too in 1989 and"
339,00:16:04.619,00:16:06.619,2.0, in my first marriage and
340,00:16:06.619,00:16:10.739,4.120002746582031, She would go and it was so funny because I thought there wasn't mourning in heaven
341,00:16:10.739,00:16:18.739,8.0, But I knew God's told me that every morning she would run and play with butterflies and hummingbirds and then I read in scripture
342,00:16:18.739,00:16:20.899,2.160003662109375, the more about the morning in heaven
343,00:16:20.899,00:16:28.419,7.5200042724609375," And I was like, wow, just so many things happen that I could never ever have made up, you know"
344,00:16:28.419,00:16:35.579,7.160003662109375, They're just no incredible things like him knowing every word before it hits my tongue. So so many things
345,00:16:35.579,00:16:37.579,2.0, dozens of scriptures now
346,00:16:37.579,00:16:45.019,7.44000244140625, But the most interesting part to me and in grace given part to me was when I was sitting on the steps of
347,00:16:45.019,00:16:47.659,2.6399993896484375, heaven and I was looking around and
348,00:16:47.659,00:16:54.779,7.1200103759765625, I just couldn't believe I was there and I just said how can it be and God's right up
349,00:16:54.779,00:17:00.139,5.3600006103515625," But it's throwing a couple, you know a few stairs ahead, you know above me him and God and the lion"
350,00:17:00.139,00:17:02.139,2.0, He was just petting the lion
351,00:17:02.139,00:17:04.139,2.0, it was so cool and
352,00:17:04.139,00:17:10.499,6.3600006103515625, And I just was looking around heaven saying how can it be that I'm here I said I I was a sinner on earth
353,00:17:10.499,00:17:12.499,2.0, I had sin. I hadn't
354,00:17:12.499,00:17:14.499,2.0, confessed of or
355,00:17:14.499,00:17:19.379,4.8800048828125," Sin, I hadn't confessed of before I died and he said just simply as ever"
356,00:17:19.379,00:17:24.499,5.1199951171875," It's because of the blood and I said I said, but I had addictions on earth"
357,00:17:24.499,00:17:30.819,6.32000732421875," I had things I hadn't overcome yet. And then he reaches down because he was human looking to me, you know"
358,00:17:30.819,00:17:37.819,7.0, And he reaches down with his big huge finger and points in my face and says and make no mistake Camille
359,00:17:37.819,00:17:39.819,2.0, I know everyone's heart
360,00:17:39.819,00:17:41.539,1.7199859619140625, because even
361,00:17:41.539,00:17:49.339,7.8000030517578125, the only thing I had questioned was that I was on pain medication because of all my pain and I've been on in pain for
362,00:17:49.339,00:17:55.419,6.0800018310546875, a couple of years honestly because of the infections I kept getting with the
363,00:17:55.419,00:18:02.819,7.4000091552734375, The mold would cause me to have bubbly rashes that would break and itch and then I it became a blood infection
364,00:18:02.819,00:18:10.179,7.3600006103515625, So that blood infection got on to my pacemaker and it went with the wires went directly into my heart
365,00:18:10.179,00:18:12.179,2.0," causing the heart failure, so"
366,00:18:12.179,00:18:18.859,6.6800079345703125, so I was in a horrific amount of pain and but I would cry to the Lord because I thought that any kind of
367,00:18:18.859,00:18:25.899,7.0399932861328125, Anything we did to to ease pain other than God could send us to hell and that's just not true
368,00:18:25.899,00:18:27.899,2.0, God wants us to be
369,00:18:27.899,00:18:32.259,4.3599853515625, Taken care of as well and it's different because I am a full believer in 1st
370,00:18:32.259,00:18:37.899,5.6400146484375, Corinthians 6 9 through 10 of willfully sinning and fornicating and and being drunkard and
371,00:18:37.899,00:18:44.379,6.480010986328125, You can't be do those things and inherit the kingdom of God. So I'm not at all saying that but at the same time
372,00:18:44.379,00:18:47.779,3.399993896484375, He understands what we're going through as well and
373,00:18:47.779,00:18:54.419,6.639984130859375, And he just when he told me make no mistake. I know everyone's heart. I just went cool great
374,00:18:54.419,00:19:00.619,6.199981689453125," Because I knew my heart, you know, it was it was always for him and and and"
375,00:19:00.619,00:19:02.699,2.079986572265625, wanting to to please him and
376,00:19:02.699,00:19:04.139,1.44000244140625, Loving him
377,00:19:04.139,00:19:08.139,4.0," Yeah, well, I would we're oftentimes trying to judge on God's behalf"
378,00:19:08.139,00:19:15.619,7.480010986328125," Yeah, when God is the only one that can judge so making an assessment one way or the other is really God's domain, isn't it?"
379,00:19:15.619,00:19:17.619,2.0," yes, and that is a"
380,00:19:17.619,00:19:21.339,3.720001220703125, We got to be so careful about that and I am too now
381,00:19:21.339,00:19:26.259,4.920013427734375," I'm so careful about that, but there are so many amazing things"
382,00:19:26.259,00:19:30.499,4.239990234375, I saw that I honestly was at church last night praying sobbing
383,00:19:30.499,00:19:34.139,3.6400146484375, Just because I can't believe he gave me all these revelations
384,00:19:34.139,00:19:39.699,5.55999755859375, And I told him that the other night and I said why why would you give someone like me? Who's this?
385,00:19:39.699,00:19:45.979,6.280029296875, Still falls. It's still I'm not perfect by any means. None of us can be but why would you give me that?
386,00:19:45.979,00:19:49.139,3.15997314453125, I don't deserve that and he just said that's why
387,00:19:49.139,00:19:54.539,5.399993896484375," Because you know who you are, you know, I know who I am and I know who I'm not and I'm not God"
388,00:19:54.539,00:19:58.059,3.52001953125, I'm just a vessel and that's all I ever
389,00:19:58.059,00:20:00.259,2.199981689453125, Dreamed to be in this life and
390,00:20:00.259,00:20:05.939,5.680023193359375, But I remember when he told me he I had to come back and he just said
391,00:20:05.939,00:20:09.339,3.399993896484375, It was kind of mixed up with the are you having fun yet comment?
392,00:20:09.339,00:20:16.019,6.67999267578125, And then he goes cuz now you got to go back and I saw this crystal heart just shatter on the floor
393,00:20:16.019,00:20:18.019,2.0, and there's this
394,00:20:18.019,00:20:24.939,6.920013427734375, Song by Hillsong that's called broken vessel and I listened to it the other day and I just cried because it reminded me of that
395,00:20:24.939,00:20:27.259,2.32000732421875, it said pieces shattered on the floor and
396,00:20:27.259,00:20:29.819,2.55999755859375, amazing grace is what it's also called and
397,00:20:29.819,00:20:35.499,5.680023193359375, He got up and I'll never forget it was the most beautiful thing ever and God has since told me
398,00:20:35.499,00:20:37.059,1.55999755859375, This is what I do on earth
399,00:20:37.059,00:20:43.179,6.1199951171875, But when I was crying he got up from his throne and I said my story is called this too
400,00:20:43.179,00:20:45.499,2.32000732421875, That I can't believe the maker of everything
401,00:20:45.499,00:20:50.459,4.96002197265625, cares if I hurt and my story's called hell versus the maker of everything and
402,00:20:50.459,00:20:54.539,4.079986572265625, He was just walked towards me. I just couldn't believe it
403,00:20:54.539,00:21:00.339,5.79998779296875, but as soon as he grabbed my hand my pain went away all of it just fell away and
404,00:21:00.339,00:21:05.579,5.239990234375, Then I remember thinking I got to watch my thoughts. I'm walking with God Almighty
405,00:21:05.579,00:21:08.699,3.1199951171875, And and he said you no longer have those thoughts
406,00:21:08.699,00:21:14.899,6.199981689453125," And I was like, oh my gosh, I don't and that's been one of the weirdest things about coming back. Is that how?"
407,00:21:14.899,00:21:21.139,6.239990234375," Inundated we are with thoughts of the enemy, you know, because there's no thoughts like that"
408,00:21:21.139,00:21:28.659,7.52001953125," Wow, you're just not only yes clean. Not only did he purify your thoughts, but you actually were healed"
409,00:21:28.659,00:21:33.819,5.160003662109375," Yeah, and you didn't need that transplant. Well, no, I didn't need the transplant. I came back"
410,00:21:33.819,00:21:38.499,4.680023193359375," They told me to go home and well, they took my left leg because it had died"
411,00:21:38.499,00:21:45.419,6.91998291015625, Below and I kind of considered that like a thorn in my flesh like Paul. He says because he'd been given so many revelations
412,00:21:45.419,00:21:49.699,4.279998779296875, To not become overconfident. He was given a thorn in his flesh and I I
413,00:21:49.699,00:21:55.659,5.959991455078125, Seriously think that has something to do with what happened because he healed everything else. So
414,00:21:55.659,00:22:01.699,6.040008544921875," But I did end up losing my left leg and some of my right toes, but I don't even walk with the limp"
415,00:22:01.699,00:22:08.659,6.959991455078125, it's so crazy and and then I came back and I also they said I was going home for a
416,00:22:08.659,00:22:12.419,3.760009765625, Quadruple bypass in August and I would tell them I don't need it
417,00:22:12.419,00:22:18.539,6.1199951171875, I went to heaven and all these things they would say I was gonna be a vegetable. I was gonna be
418,00:22:18.539,00:22:21.899,3.3599853515625," Going to the bathroom, you know in diapers"
419,00:22:21.899,00:22:24.459,2.55999755859375," All these things I said, no, I won't I went to heaven"
420,00:22:24.459,00:22:29.659,5.20001220703125," and and then sure enough a year later, I went to the hospital to OHSU and"
421,00:22:29.659,00:22:32.739,3.08001708984375, Daddy woods the head nurse now still in cardiology
422,00:22:32.739,00:22:37.579,4.84002685546875, Said Camille tell me what you told me back then and I said that I won't need it
423,00:22:37.579,00:22:43.219,5.63995361328125, I went to heaven and she cried and she said that my heart is actually healthier now
424,00:22:43.219,00:22:47.019,3.79998779296875, Than before I got sick and I had two two by two
425,00:22:47.019,00:22:52.859,5.84002685546875, Infections on my right side of my heart that were healed and I also had an arm from the stroke that was kinked
426,00:22:52.859,00:22:57.979,5.1199951171875, like this and then God in the hospital bed told me just lay my arm across it and
427,00:22:57.979,00:23:01.619,3.63995361328125, He just gave me all these tips and for my brain to learn music
428,00:23:01.619,00:23:02.939,1.32000732421875, and
429,00:23:02.939,00:23:05.339,2.4000244140625," Yeah, he's just he's the healer"
430,00:23:05.339,00:23:10.179,4.8399658203125, God is so good. You know everyone that we talk with him. We talk Camille
431,00:23:10.179,00:23:12.179,2.0, Who has died?
432,00:23:12.179,00:23:15.019,2.84002685546875," And come back has been healed, right?"
433,00:23:15.019,00:23:21.219,6.20001220703125," The death of what caused that death. Yeah, and you are a prime example of that"
434,00:23:21.219,00:23:26.399,5.17999267578125, Yeah of all of the experiences that you had that's stay in heaven
435,00:23:26.399,00:23:28.399,2.0, What struck you the most?
436,00:23:28.399,00:23:30.399,2.0, When he got it from his throne
437,00:23:30.399,00:23:32.399,2.0, That will always be I
438,00:23:32.399,00:23:33.719,1.3199462890625, loved
439,00:23:33.719,00:23:40.559,6.84002685546875," Seeing my kids and just that they're happy, you know, I miss him terribly and with the holidays coming up"
440,00:23:40.559,00:23:45.919,5.3599853515625," It's hard, you know, it's kind of hard to see them physically, you know like to"
441,00:23:45.919,00:23:50.879,4.9599609375," See them, but that was another thing about heaven is nobody has any skin color"
442,00:23:50.879,00:23:55.439,4.55999755859375," We're all just gods, right? So we're all just translucent shiny"
443,00:23:55.439,00:23:58.079,2.63995361328125, Glittery glittery beautiful
444,00:23:58.079,00:24:00.079,2.0," But yeah, it was definitely"
445,00:24:00.079,00:24:03.719,3.6400146484375, When he stood up from his throne because you can't imagine
446,00:24:03.719,00:24:07.279,3.55999755859375," Seeing that I mean, I'm just me, you know"
447,00:24:07.279,00:24:12.519,5.239990234375," I've done a lot in my life that I'm forgiven for thank God, but um"
448,00:24:12.519,00:24:16.879,4.3599853515625, But if he does it for me with all the sin I've done in my life
449,00:24:16.879,00:24:18.559,1.67999267578125, and
450,00:24:18.559,00:24:20.639,2.0799560546875, He'll do it for anybody. I mean
451,00:24:20.639,00:24:25.759,5.1199951171875, And it was all just because I was brokenhearted and he said that's what I do
452,00:24:25.759,00:24:30.999,5.24005126953125, And you do there are people right now who are watching or listening to this and
453,00:24:30.999,00:24:32.999,2.0, Their hearts are being changed Wow
454,00:24:32.999,00:24:38.919,5.91998291015625, And those who have been broken are thinking God has abandoned them and you could have
455,00:24:38.919,00:24:45.479,6.55999755859375, Well thought that or said that that God had abandoned you right because of your suffering your entire life
456,00:24:45.479,00:24:47.479,2.0, up to that point
457,00:24:47.479,00:24:53.799,6.3199462890625, And losing your your leg and and but you didn't and you said because you had been to heaven
458,00:24:53.799,00:24:59.319,5.52001953125," Well, and you're taking us to heaven and you saw the might and the awe of God"
459,00:24:59.319,00:25:03.639,4.32000732421875, There's nothing that compares on this earth is no no no way
460,00:25:03.639,00:25:09.119,5.48004150390625, That's why I making sure I go back and I'm trying to bring as many people with me
461,00:25:09.119,00:25:11.119,2.0, Because I want the other
462,00:25:11.119,00:25:14.439,3.32000732421875, You shouldn't and when he told you that he was returning you
463,00:25:14.439,00:25:16.439,2.0, When you knew you were being returned
464,00:25:16.439,00:25:16.879,0.44000244140625, Yeah
465,00:25:16.879,00:25:21.999,5.1199951171875, Did was there a reason that he explained to you or was it just since he has?
466,00:25:21.999,00:25:24.279,2.280029296875, I came back and I would like I said
467,00:25:24.279,00:25:29.799,5.52001953125, I would cry all the time and I was in my car one day and somebody had given me this little scripture on a piece of
468,00:25:29.799,00:25:34.359,4.55999755859375, Paper and it flew at my feet like no wind nothing
469,00:25:34.359,00:25:37.279,2.91998291015625, It just flew at my feet and I pick it up and it's Esther for
470,00:25:37.279,00:25:42.679,5.4000244140625, 14 for who knows if you come to the kingdom but for such a time as this and I said
471,00:25:42.679,00:25:48.639,5.9599609375," I was just stunned and I said, I don't know why I said this but my spirit just said is this the end and"
472,00:25:48.639,00:25:51.679,3.0400390625, I'm in of humanity of everything and God said yes
473,00:25:51.679,00:25:58.999,7.32000732421875, So you must tell him must tell them that I am real and it is all the Bible it is all real
474,00:25:58.999,00:26:06.239,7.239990234375," Hmm. Yeah, there's no there was no imagination. No dream at that point. No, you were fully aware"
475,00:26:06.239,00:26:11.519,5.27996826171875," Yeah, and physiologically and I you know, I had been in the cardiovascular space for some time"
476,00:26:11.519,00:26:18.559,7.03997802734375, Physiologically and mentally your brain was was really not functioning at that point. It's just great. You could not have
477,00:26:18.559,00:26:20.239,1.67999267578125, physically
478,00:26:20.239,00:26:22.799,2.55999755859375, Imagined or dreamed of any of us you were in the spirit
479,00:26:22.799,00:26:28.959,6.15997314453125," Yeah, and plus the just the it was beyond reality if anyone can imagine that this feels fake"
480,00:26:28.959,00:26:34.519,5.55999755859375, This has always felt fake since I came back and then that's when I got that's my home
481,00:26:34.519,00:26:36.519,2.0, That's the end goal
482,00:26:36.519,00:26:42.279,5.760009765625," My sister we share that I believe that this world is fake. Yeah, the heaven is real"
483,00:26:42.279,00:26:49.639,7.3599853515625," Heaven is more real than this world. Yeah, that's a conundrum, isn't it? We just can't comprehend that. Yeah within our brain"
484,00:26:49.639,00:26:54.399,4.760009765625," Yeah, this is all seems fake, but it doesn't seem worthless, you know"
485,00:26:54.399,00:27:02.719,8.32000732421875, Because we all get to go back there and just so many things happened. I mean I could still go on. It's just amazing
486,00:27:02.719,00:27:04.119,1.39996337890625, Yeah
487,00:27:04.119,00:27:08.079,3.96002197265625, That is amazing. So what are you doing today then obviously you're speaking with us
488,00:27:08.079,00:27:11.119,3.0400390625," Well, God told you you would do that's happening right now"
489,00:27:11.119,00:27:14.039,2.9200439453125," Yeah, so what is your life like now Camille?"
490,00:27:14.039,00:27:19.199,5.15997314453125, Well as you were calling I was watching a video getting ready for my Sunday school class tomorrow morning
491,00:27:19.199,00:27:21.199,2.0, So I serve I serve
492,00:27:21.199,00:27:28.079,6.8800048828125, Because I know how important that is. I know that we need to serve Cod's Kingdom. We had to be part of the body
493,00:27:28.079,00:27:33.799,5.719970703125, It is very important for us to understand that it's not just showing up whenever you think you can
494,00:27:33.799,00:27:38.199,4.4000244140625," Or you know, if you feel guilty, it's being active part of his body"
495,00:27:38.199,00:27:44.479,6.280029296875, It's very important. So I am my life revolves around God since especially
496,00:27:44.479,00:27:47.439,2.9599609375, and and your home situation is
497,00:27:47.439,00:27:50.359,2.9200439453125," So I'm single, but I just got engaged last Sunday"
498,00:27:50.359,00:27:53.759,3.39996337890625," Amazing man, unfortunately my husband from all that experience"
499,00:27:53.759,00:27:55.759,2.0, became quite abusive so
500,00:27:55.759,00:27:59.699,3.940000057220459," I had to leave that, but God has completely restored my life"
501,00:27:59.699,00:28:01.139,1.440000057220459, in every single way.
502,00:28:01.139,00:28:03.239,2.0999999046325684," So I live alone right now,"
503,00:28:03.239,00:28:04.839,1.5999999046325684, but we're buying a house together
504,00:28:04.839,00:28:07.839,3.0," and then we're gonna be married in that house, so."
505,00:28:07.839,00:28:09.579,1.739999771118164," Well, congratulations."
506,00:28:09.579,00:28:13.439,3.8600006103515625, God has worked a miracle in numerous ways.
