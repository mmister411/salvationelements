In that video, I emphasized the fact that all 37 of those people, indicated here with a verification checkmark, lived during the Iron Age or later. This is because the Bible is basically an Iron Age book, meaning that it was during the Iron Age that the Bible started to be written. To put it another way, by the time the biblical authors put ink to parchment, the Bronze Age was already a distant memory and therefore they had to rely on a lot of guesswork, mixed with imagination, to come up with stories from earlier times. Which is why Genesis and Exodus read more like myth and legend than, say, 2 Kings, which includes a lot of historical details that nicely line up with what we know from other sources.

Now, while critical scholars are all basically in agreement about all of this, there are still some people from certain religious circles who continue to believe that the Bible is 100% literal history. These people sometimes cite certain archaeological finds as evidence for biblical characters from the Bronze Age. Therefore, in today's video, I'm going to take a look at some of these claims and I'm going to do so with the help of Religion for Breakfast, Tablets and Temples, Dig It With Raven, Al-Muqaddimah, and Digital Hammurabi.

But before we jump into it, I want to tell you about a shortcast that I've been listening to on Blinkist. A shortcast is simply a short podcast and Blinkist has lots of them. As you might know, Blinkist is a website and app that provides you with the main ideas of over 6,500 books, which you can either read or listen to, usually in less than 30 minutes, and sometimes in even less than 15. I often check out a book on Blinkist before making a decision on whether or not I want to purchase and read the whole book.

Well, Blinkist also has shortcasts, such as Dan Snow's History Hit. I recently listened to this episode, entitled Archaeology, Discoveries, and Historical Biases. In fact, it helped me in preparing this video and I think you'd like it too.

Alright, back to the Bronze Age.

Let's begin by taking a closer look at where the division between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age occurs on our Biblical family tree chart. Basically, the dividing line would look something like this. So, characters such as the Three Patriarchs, as well as Moses, all belong in the Bronze Age, whereas characters like Devorah, Ruth, David, and Samuel belong in the Early Iron Age. As mentioned in our previous video, the earliest Israelite leader for whom we have a contemporary extra-biblical source for is Omri. We do have an earlier mention of David outside of the Bible but it's not actually from a contemporary source as it only mentions him as being the ancestor of a later king. So if we want a contemporary source, then no, we don't actually have anything for David.
        Copy



However, when it comes to non-Israelites mentioned by name in the Bible, we do have someone even earlier than Omri and that is Shoshenq I. Being that he was a pharaoh of Egypt, we have lots of contemporary extra-biblical sources for him. Okay, so the goal of this video is to see if we can get a verification checkmark for anyone even earlier than Shoshenq and in particular, someone on the Bronze Age side of this big blue line.
        Copy



So let's start with who I think is the best possible candidate for making this happen. He's not actually shown on this family tree chart but if he was, he'd be placed somewhere here as a contemporary of Moses. I'll let Dr. Andrew Mark Henry from Religion for Breakfast explain more. Balaam son of Beor is one of the more mysterious figures in the Bible, a non-Israelite prophet who does the bidding of the God of Israel, only to be later cast as a villain and killed by the Israelites. He appears in the book of Numbers chapter 22.
        Copy



The Israelites are nearing the end of their 40-year wander through the wilderness after escaping from Egypt and they're camped on the plains of Moab, just northeast of the Dead Sea in modern-day Jordan. And the Moabites are understandably alarmed. The Israelites have just destroyed a few of their neighbors and the Moabites are afraid that they're next. So the king of Moab decides to hire Balaam, who was famous for his very effective blessings and curses. Maybe with some supernatural help, with Balaam cursing the Israelites, the Moabites can properly defend themselves.
        Copy



While Balaam journeys to Moab on a donkey, God grows angry with him and sends an angel to block his path. The donkey can see the angel; Balaam can't, and while Balaam is striking the donkey trying to get it to move, the donkey starts talking and is like, "Hey, why are you doing this to me?" Finally, Balaam sees the angel of the Lord who says, "You can go to the Moabites but speak only what I tell you to speak." And so when Balaam arrives, instead of cursing the Israelites, he blesses them in a series of four poetic oracles.
        Copy



Now up until the 1960s, that's basically all we knew about Balaam, along with a few other passing references in the Bible. But in 1967, archaeologists discovered an inscription on a few pieces of plaster at an archaeological site called Deir Allah. The Deir Allah inscription dates to around 800 BCE and it's written in a Canaanite dialect with some similarities with Aramaic. It starts: "This is the book of Balaam son of Beor, a seer of the gods. The gods came to him at night and he beheld a vision in accordance with El's utterance."
        Copy



So here we have an extra-biblical reference to a seer named Balaam. Critical scholars agree that this is referencing the same character that we see in Numbers. The text describes the chief god of the Canaanite pantheon, El, coming to him with a message of disaster: The gods have banded together. The Shaddai gods have established a council and they have said to the god of Shagar: So up close up the heavens with a dense cloud that darkness exists there not brilliance.
        Copy



So Balaam learns of a plan from the Shaddain—some sort of divine council of gods who oppose the chief god El—and they're planning to blanket the land in darkness. The text, as you can see, is very fragmentary but it seems that Balaam successfully averts the Shaddain's plan.
        Copy



The story in Numbers and the Deir Allah inscription demonstrate that Balaam was a known character in the region east of the Jordan River. Now some scholars think he was a historical figure—some sort of wandering prophet for hire—but at the very least this is evidence of a shared tradition in the region about a heavily mythologized celebrity prophet.
        Copy



When we compare this inscription with the Book of Numbers we can see how Israelite religion was embedded in the local cultural context and has affinities with other religious traditions in the region. In the Deir Allah inscription Balaam is a prophet for the chief god El; and in several instances in his oracles in the Book of Numbers he refers to the god of Israel as El.
        Copy



We see something similar with the council of gods in the Deir Allah inscription called the Shaddain. Shaddain is a plural form of the word Shaddai which appears in Balaam's oracles referencing the Israelite god—the oracle of Balaam who hears the words of El who sees the vision of Shaddai—usually translated as God and The Almighty respectively. And narratively speaking scholars have pointed out similarities between the story in Numbers and the inscription. Both include poetic oracles; and both include the plot point of having a vision at night that's then reported next morning.
        Copy



Scholars argue that this means the story in Numbers knows what a Balaam story should sound like—in other words if Balaam is a stock character in local folklore then it would have been a literary convention to include a nocturnal vision. So scholars generally agree that Deir Allah inscription—and at least parts of story in Numbers—derive from same cultural context though repackaged for different audiences.
        Copy



Now none of this proves historicity of story in Numbers—the Deir Allah inscription dates to Iron Age around 800 BCE; Book of Numbers describes narrative that claims to be situated in Late Bronze Age maybe around 15th century BCE; but Numbers itself book composed centuries later also during Iron Age—so we're talking span hundreds years between supposed events Numbers 22 date composition both Deir Allah inscription Numbers 22—it's more likely both these texts drawing on local tradition about Balaam circulating east Jordan River in 9th-7th centuries BCE.
        Copy



The story in Numbers also seems to reflect political reality Iron Age when Kingdom Moab frequent rival Israelite kingdoms—so as Dr Henry explained it possible Balaam fact real historical person however extra-biblical source comes Iron Age not Bronze Age—in other words it's not contemporary source—or could be Balaam actually lived Iron Age biblical authors simply placed further back time—either way we can't give Balaam same kind verification can give Shashank Omri—Balaam's verification more level David.
        Copy



Regardless Deir Allah inscription amazing find does least open possibility Bible contains reference real Bronze Age person important enough region his name remembered centuries later—let's now take look most important biblical figure from Bronze Age—Moses—is there any evidence archaeological record him? Well there's one particular inscription some argue does fact mention Moses—I'm going let PhD candidate Lachlan Davis up-and-coming YouTube channel Tablets Temples tell more.
        Copy



This Sinai 361 inscription one several carved inscriptions discovered near ancient mining site Sinai Peninsula—bold claims made these texts contain name Moses,—well as descriptions events Exodus such as Moses performing miracles creating bronze serpent statue—the inscriptions date 2nd millennium BCE written Proto-Sinaitic oldest known alphabetic script from which Phoenician Paleo-Hebrew alphabet descended—so these writings evidence Moses Exodus?
        Copy



One such advocate Dr Douglas Petrovich translates inscription follows: Our bound servitude has lingered Moses then provoked astonishment—it year astonishment because lady—such reading evokes images slavery miracles performed Moses book Exodus—another translation Professor Kramalkov reads: This site where stood snake bronze Mashae meaning Moses Mahub-Baalt made argues reference bronze serpent Moses created book Numbers.
        Copy



While these sensational claims exciting reality these translations heavily criticized texts likely don't say Moses at all—the Hebrew name Moses comes Egyptian word Messi meaning give birth has s as its middle letter however translators who found Moses Sinai inscriptions mistaken letter Phoenician s sound when it's actually Sinaitic th letter as thin—so word name probably math which means twin Ugaritic—scholar Dr Aaron Wilson-Wright has demonstrated sensational Moses translations rely restoring words aren't inscription inventing new meanings other words she proposes following translation:

O returner those who tell people about math beloved lady—the lady Egyptian goddess Hathor—this common expression among Sinai inscriptions—another text Sinai 351 reads: Beloved lady those who tell people about math miner extractor—and still another 349 calls math chief miners—it appears these inscriptions commemorate mining official possibly named math offer blessings Hathor—the texts make no reference Moses snakes miracles fascinating example writing world's oldest alphabet scholars continuing work deciphering them.
        Copy


Okay maybe those inscriptions don't refer Moses but there's lots other evidence Exodus right? Well no—in recent years several popular documentaries come which claim go through lots evidence Exodus but each case evidence presented extremely flimsy not verified any actual experts—for topic going let real archaeologist Raven De Silva channel Dig It With Raven explain further she has new book coming called Other Ancient Civilizations decoding archaeology's less celebrated cultures which I'll leave link description over you Raven.
Two stone pillars flank Gulf Aqaba Red Sea Supposedly erected King Solomon commemorate crossing Red Sea Hebrews freed Moses but these pillars actual archaeological evidence biblical event? Get into it—In 1978 Ron Wyatt American nurse anesthetist amateur archaeologist claimed made over 100 biblical archaeological discoveries found red granite pillar Egyptian side Gulf Nuweiba according report found its side water itself today side road erected concrete about 500 feet away beach Wyatt said supposedly inscription should been inscription pillar since eroded away he said Hebrew Phoenician origin dated around 3 000 years old tried look pillar date off photos biblical documentaries out there but there aren't really many very detailed high quality images pillar so really difficult do so can't tell how old confidence looking design pillar don't know you looks very non-descript means could be from anywhere



For any time throughout history, to be honest, unless we get a closer look at it and do some actual scientific research on it. The pillar doesn't have a capital, so that also doesn't really help in its identification. And when I think of Phoenician pillar, I think of this. Ron Wyatt himself did not do any scientific studies on it, from what I've seen, because there are no peer-reviewed papers out there to actually talk about any of his discoveries. So again, there's nothing firmly documenting it anywhere saying that it was from 3,000 years ago and it is of this design.
        Copy



In 1984, Wyatt claimed that he found a second pillar directly opposite Nuweiba on the opposite side of the Gulf in Saudi Arabia. It was apparently immediately removed by Saudi authorities, but it was apparently inscribed with the following words on it: Yahweh, Pharaoh, Mizraim, or Egypt, Moses, Death, Water, Solomon, and Edom. In what context? Wyatt didn't say. He also didn't mention any fragments of words or other words that maybe were, you know, connecting words or sentence words. And he didn't mention, like, the placement of the words or what context. There's no rubbing of the words or any photographic evidence of the words. So it all just seems very convenient and keyword-themed.
        Copy



It's almost like he was doing SEO for a pillar. There's an extra layer of convenience as well because it was a mysterious pillar that was found and then it was swiftly taken away immediately, only to have, like, a plaque in Saudi Arabia marking where it was. And that's literally the only physical remains that we have, is this, like, little commemorative plaque on the other side of the Red Sea. If Wyatt had taken any sort of photos of the pillar or, again, inscriptions, anything like that, then we could maybe talk about its legitimacy and a little bit more of the dating and its connection to the one in Nuweiba. But until then, you know, it's one of those things where the jury's out and you won't be able to convince me until I see some hard scientific evidence.
        Copy



I also quickly want to point out that King Solomon supposedly erected these pillars 400 years after the Red Sea crossing apparently happened. Even if he did erect these pillars, that doesn't actually mean that the crossing of the Red Sea happened. People erect religious monuments all the time, and if it was so long after it happened, it doesn't actually confirm that this event took place.
        Copy



What I do find interesting is that Ron and his sons found and photographed supposed coral-encrusted chariot pieces at the bottom of the Red Sea, as well as chariot wheels and bones belonging to both humans and horses. Apparently some of the wood that they found had gold gilding on it, but it was too deteriorated and fragile to actually be removed from the water for any further scientific study. Images of these finds were shown to Dr. Nassif Mohamed Hassan, the director of Egyptian antiquities at the time, though whenever I google his name only biblical websites come up, so... But Dr. Hassan claimed that one of the wheels was from the 18th dynasty, apparently this is the only time that an eight-spoked wheel was used in ancient Egypt, which does include the reign of Rameses II.
        Copy



I'm not an expert in Egyptian chariots, so I can't tell you, like, how many spokes were used for the wheels throughout all of Egyptian history, but I can show you an image of Rameses II in a chariot when he was fighting the Hittites. Overall there's just a lot of speculation and looking at something that could fit and making a claim without any sort of scientific evidence to back you up.
        Copy



Also, I'm sorry, you can't look at this coral formation and immediately claim that it's an entire ancient set of chariot wheels still attached to its axle. All of the overlays on these bits of coral supposedly marking out all of the spokes on a wheel are just wild to me. I'm not an underwater archaeologist, but this just looks... it just doesn't look right. Doesn't look right at all. Apparently a human femur that Ron Wyatt found in the Red Sea was tested at Stockholm University and it was determined that it came from a man about 165 to 170 centimeters tall, but from what I saw, there was no documentation stating actually how old it was.
        Copy



So again, it could have just been... it can just be a bone. It might have just been a bone that was in the sea from someone else at any other point in history. Contrary to some beliefs, archaeology is in fact a science and we don't make any conclusions unless there is irrefutable evidence that has been checked multiple times by varying methods.
        Copy



So until there are proper archaeological tests, surveys, excavations, to me the Pillar of Solomon will remain simply a pillar in my eyes and all of the coral remains underneath the water will simply be a rich, biodiverse home for sea life. So yeah, this all boils down to how archaeology actually works in the real world. You can't just say oh I found this thing but oops I didn't take photos and now it's gone. Or I think these fuzzy photos kind of look like wheels, but no expert has ever seemed bothered to take a closer look at them.
        Copy



Even though the government of Egypt makes lots of money off tourism and is usually more than willing to examine just about anything if they think it is legitimate. So the bottom line is, major discoveries are always reported in peer-reviewed journals so that other experts can chime in and either debate things or verify things. They are not announced via commercially made documentaries.
        Copy



This general principle can be applied to lots more ridiculous claims that biblical literalists make, such as that this structure in Turkey is Noah's Ark or that this statue is Joseph because it comes from around the right time and place and the figure appears to be wearing a multi-colored coat. But just because something seems to fit the biblical narrative, it doesn't automatically mean that it does.
        Copy



Okay, so when it comes to Moses and the Exodus story, there is currently no archaeological evidence that points to a person like the Bible describes or an event like the Bible describes. Now that doesn't mean that there was definitely no Moses-like person. Probably the story is based on something. But it's safe to assume that the biblical version of Moses and the Exodus is more literature than it is literal history.
        Copy



But what about the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? When it comes to them, there's a claim out there that goes far beyond just finding their names etched into stones. In this case, some people believe that we actually know their precise burial place. Muslims, in particular, believe that at this site in Hebron, known as the Cave of the Patriarchs lay not only the actual bones of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob but of Adam and Eve as well.
        Copy



I'll let the Useful Charts animator, Siawish Raymond, who also hosts the Islamic History Channel Al-Muqaddimah explain. In 638 CE, the Holy Land came under control of the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions Islam. The Rashidun Caliphate under Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab conquered cities like Jerusalem Gaza and Hebron which marked the transfer of biblical holy sites many of which are holy to Muslims Jews and Christians to Muslims.
        Copy



While Caliphate didn’t persecute religious minorities and even protected many sacred sites such as Church Holy Sepulcher many other sites were converted to Islamic tradition made into mosques Among these newly Islamized mosques Ibrahimi Mosque which previously Byzantine era basilica enclosed Herodian era complex This complex built shortly before birth Jesus on top cave known Cave Patriarchs called because according traditions Judaism Christianity Islam where patriarchs wives buried It's said patriarch Abraham known Ibrahim bought this cave wife Sarah passed away Then Abraham son Isaac Isaac’s son Jacob were buried along their wives Sarah Rebecca respectively According sources Adam Eve buried well The complex we see today was built King Herod Great Judea shortly before Jesus born However Josephus wrote much about Herod’s construction projects doesn’t give him credit complex In 2020 paper published mentioned pottery found site multiple cities dated far back 8th century BCE This puts site location visited people maybe all over Holy Land far back during days Kingdom Judah Babylonian exile still some two centuries future point What we know Judaism today rabbinic Judaism didn’t exist its current form all However while century BCE quite back still around years Abraham supposed lived which around BCE or According majority academic scholars Adam Abraham Isaac Jacob purely mythological characters did exist Since didn’t exist burial sites didn’t exist either However didn’t stop people from claiming have found bones down During Islamic era forbidden go caves below complex form respect patriarchs However there brief period around century century precise Holy Land under Christian control after First Crusade During period caves accessible monk claimed have found bones Although many sites around world claim burial sites various biblical Quranic figures there even multiple places claiming burial place same person Therefore whole thing isn’t very scientific
        Copy



Okay so safe say traceable activity Cave Patriarch site goes further back than Iron Age even though supposedly contains remains people from Bronze Age So unless someone opens tombs tests supposed bones there this site cannot used evidence existence any biblical character And same goes for plethoras other sites most which Islamic claim hold bones other biblical characters such Abel Noah Moses
        Copy



Okay so actually going end video positive note That’s because particular figure Bronzes Age whom we have lots contemporary evidence for might actually mentioned name Bible So this not central biblical character rather foreign figure maybe referenced passing biblical text matter fact it’s Bronze Age figure whose name very well known Hammurabi Kind Babylon So obviously last segment I had ask seriologist Dr Joshua Bowen channel Digital Hammurabi his thoughts Genesis we read Now days Amraphel king Shinar Ariak king Elisar Kedorlaomer king Elam Tidal king foreign peoples Who are these kings Because Shinar known name land Babylonia Hebrew Bible led scholars look Babylonian king whom identify first Amraphel late century king Shinar identified Hammurabi assuming A Kurdish form name been confused brought Hebrew text However scholars later moved away view significant development came publication relatively late cuneiform texts likely copied earlier texts earlyst millennial BCE known Spartoling these texts described four fought against city Babylon late century Pinches scholar published tablets name Amarphamell Amarphalgamal connection between name Kedoriamelamar Kedorlaomer Genesis This let scholars looking names other kings retries make connections Genesis tablets Babylonia named adaptation marr Marminlu

The name Amraphel, she writes, either Hammurabi with an unexplained suffix "l" or Amudpl, king of Katna, with the common misreading of the letter "r" for "d," possibly a confusion of the two names. Although research in the last two decades, particularly from material from the time of Hammurabi at the city of Mari, has moved scholars back toward identifying the Genesis 14 names, including Amraphel, king of Shinar, with kings from the time of Hammurabi, it would appear that we still do not possess enough information to draw definitive conclusions.
        Copy



Okay, so that's a maybe and a very interesting one at that. If the Amraphel mentioned in Genesis 14 is in fact a reference to the great king Hammurabi of Babylon, then that means that Hammurabi is the oldest known historical figure mentioned by name in the Bible. And it also means that we have verification for at least one Bronze Age person.
        Copy



Now, it actually makes sense that Hammurabi's name in particular might have found its way into the Bible. According to critical scholars, Genesis 14 was most likely written during the Babylonian captivity, which took place following 586 BCE. Being that Hammurabi was one of the most famous Babylonian kings of all time, it's not hard to believe that the Judahite scribes living in Babylon during the 500s might have heard about him and might have decided to work him into their nation's origin story.
        Copy



So, the conclusion is still that there is a huge difference when it comes to the Bronze Age parts of the Bible and the Iron Age parts. The names of the main characters from the Iron Age section are relatively easy to find in the archaeological record, whereas the names of the main characters from the Bronze Age section are not. Likewise, the Iron Age parts contain lots of references to foreign individuals who are known to be real historical people, whereas the Bronze Age parts have, at best, just two references.

Okay, so that was a look at the Bible and the Bronze Age. Special thanks to all my fellow YouTubers who helped with this video.
