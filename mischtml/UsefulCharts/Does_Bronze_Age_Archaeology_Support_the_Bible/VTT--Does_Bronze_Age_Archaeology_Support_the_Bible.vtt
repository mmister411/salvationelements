00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
 Hi, this is Matt Baker. About a year ago, we posted a video called

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:10.319
 37 Bible Characters Found Through Archaeology. In that video, I emphasized the fact that

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:15.920
 all 37 of those people, indicated here with a verification checkmark, lived during the

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.100
 Iron Age or later. This is because the Bible is basically an Iron Age book, meaning that

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.319
 it was during the Iron Age that the Bible started to be written.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:30.760
 To put it another way, by the time the biblical authors put ink to parchment, the Bronze Age

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.000
 was already a distant memory and therefore they had to rely on a lot of guesswork, mixed

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.880
 with imagination, to come up with stories from earlier times. Which is why Genesis and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.360
 Exodus read more like myth and legend than, say, 2 Kings, which includes a lot of historical

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.479
 details that nicely line up with what we know from other sources.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.240
 Now, while critical scholars are all basically in agreement about all of this, there are

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.400
 still some people from certain religious circles who continue to believe that the Bible is

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.119
 100% literal history. These people sometimes cite certain archaeological finds as evidence

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.719
 for biblical characters from the Bronze Age. Therefore, in today's video, I'm going

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.479
 to take a look at some of these claims and I'm going to do so with the help of Religion

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.520
 for Breakfast, Tablets and Temples, Dig It With Raven, Al-Muqaddimah, and Digital Hammurabi.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 But before we jump into it, I want to tell you about a shortcast that I've been listening

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.920
 to on Blinkist. A shortcast is simply a short podcast and Blinkist has lots of them. As

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 you might know, Blinkist is a website and app that provides you with the main ideas

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.079
 of over 6,500 books, which you can either read or listen to, usually in less than 30

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.280
 minutes, and sometimes in even less than 15. I often check out a book on Blinkist before

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.960
 making a decision on whether or not I want to purchase and read the whole book. Well,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.840
 Blinkist also has shortcasts, such as Dan Snow's History Hit. I recently listened

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 to this episode, entitled Archaeology, Discoveries, and Historical Biases. In fact, it helped

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.040
 me in preparing this video and I think you'd like it too. So if you'd like to get a 7-day

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.200
 Alright, back to the Bronze Age. Let's begin by taking a closer look at where the division

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.800
 between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age occurs on our Biblical family tree chart. Basically,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.200
 the dividing line would look something like this. So, characters such as the Three Patriarchs,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.600
 as well as Moses, all belong in the Bronze Age, whereas characters like Devorah, Ruth,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.640
 David, and Samuel belong in the Early Iron Age.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.900
 As mentioned in our previous video, the earliest Israelite leader for whom we have a contemporary

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.800
 extra-biblical source for is Omri. We do have an earlier mention of David outside of the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.479
 Bible but it's not actually from a contemporary source as it only mentions him as being the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:19.880
 ancestor of a later king. So if we want a contemporary source, then no, we don't actually

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.200
 have anything for David. However, when it comes to non-Israelites mentioned by name

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.080
 in the Bible, we do have someone even earlier than Omri and that is Shoshenq I. Being that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.360
 he was a pharaoh of Egypt, we have lots of contemporary extra-biblical sources for him.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360
 Okay, so the goal of this video is to see if we can get a verification checkmark for

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.160
 anyone even earlier than Shoshenq and in particular, someone on the Bronze Age side of this big

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.560
 blue line. So let's start with who I think is the best possible candidate for making

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.520
 this happen. He's not actually shown on this family tree chart but if he was, he'd

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.880
 be placed somewhere here as a contemporary of Moses. I'll let Dr. Andrew Mark Henry

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.360
 from Religion for Breakfast explain more.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.040
 Balaam son of Beor is one of the more mysterious figures in the Bible, a non-Israelite prophet

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.679
 who does the bidding of the God of Israel, only to be later cast as a villain and killed

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:24.040
 by the Israelites. He appears in the book of Numbers chapter 22. The Israelites are

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.959
 nearing the end of their 40-year wander through the wilderness after escaping from Egypt and

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:32.679
 they're camped on the plains of Moab, just northeast of the Dead Sea in modern-day Jordan.

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:37.239
 And the Moabites are understandably alarmed. The Israelites have just destroyed a few of

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:41.239
 their neighbors and the Moabites are afraid that they're next. So the king of Moab decides

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:46.560
 to hire Balaam, who was famous for his very effective blessings and curses. Maybe with

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.040
 some supernatural help, with Balaam cursing the Israelites, the Moabites can properly

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.799
 defend themselves. While Balaam journeys to Moab on a donkey, God grows angry with him

00:04:55.799 --> 00:05:00.679
 and sends an angel to block his path. The donkey can see the angel, Balaam can't, and

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:04.760
 while Balaam is striking the donkey trying to get it to move, the donkey starts talking

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.519
 and is like, hey, why are you doing this to me? Finally, Balaam sees the angel of the

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:12.920
 Lord who says, you can go to the Moabites, but speak only what I tell you to speak. And

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.600
 so when Balaam arrives, instead of cursing the Israelites, he blesses them in a series

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.480
 of four poetic oracles. Now up until the 1960s, that's basically all we knew about Balaam,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.040
 along with a few other passing references in the Bible. But in 1967, archaeologists

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.119
 discovered an inscription on a few pieces of plaster at an archaeological site called

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:37.640
 Deir Allah. The Deir Allah inscription dates to around 800 BCE, and it's written in a Canaanite

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.840
 dialect with some similarities with Aramaic. It starts,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.000
 This is the book of Balaam, son of Beor, a seer of the gods. The gods came to him at

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.119
 night, and he beheld a vision in accordance with El's utterance.

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:54.119
 So here we have an extra biblical reference to a seer named Balaam. Critical scholars

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:58.480
 agree that this is referencing the same character that we see in Numbers. The text describes

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.679
 the chief god of the Canaanite pantheon, El, coming to him with a message of disaster.

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:06.720
 The gods have banded together. The Shaddai gods have established a council, and they

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.880
 have said to the god of Shagar, So up, close up the heavens with a dense cloud. That darkness

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.060
 exists there, not brilliance. So Balaam learns of a plan from the Shaddain, some sort of

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.959
 divine council of gods who oppose the chief god El, and they're planning to blanket the

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:26.560
 land in darkness. The text, as you can see, is very fragmentary, but it seems that Balaam

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.480
 successfully averts the Shaddain's plan. The story in Numbers and the Deir Allah inscription

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.160
 demonstrate that Balaam was a known character in the region east of the Jordan River. Now,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.360
 some scholars think he was a historical figure, some sort of wandering prophet for hire, but

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.040
 at the very least, this is evidence of a shared tradition in the region about a heavily mythologized

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.799
 celebrity prophet. When we compare this inscription with the Book of Numbers, we can see how Israelite

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:54.899
 religion was embedded in the local cultural context and has affinities with other religious

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.700
 traditions in the region. In the Deir Allah inscription, Balaam is a prophet for the chief

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.700
 god El, and in several instances in his oracles in the Book of Numbers, he refers to the god

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.860
 of Israel as El. We see something similar with the council of gods in the Deir Allah

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.420
 inscription called the Shaddain. Shaddain is a plural form of the word Shaddai, which

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.299
 appears in Balaam's oracles referencing the Israelite god, the oracle of Balaam who hears

00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:22.299
 the words of El, who sees the vision of the Shaddai, usually translated as God and the

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:26.820
 Almighty respectively. And narratively speaking, scholars have pointed out similarities between

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.980
 the story in Numbers and the inscription. Both include poetic oracles, and both include

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.220
 the plot point of having a vision at night that's then reported the next morning. Scholars

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.220
 argue that this means the story in Numbers knows what a Balaam story should sound like.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.780
 In other words, if Balaam is a stock character in the local folklore, then it would have

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.579
 been a literary convention to include a nocturnal vision. So scholars generally agree that the

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:52.340
 Deir Allah inscription, and at least parts of the story in Numbers, derive from the same

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.920
 cultural context, though repackaged for different audiences. Now, none of this proves the historicity

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.799
 of the story in Numbers. The Deir Allah inscription dates to the Iron Age, around 800 BCE. The

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:08.320
 Book of Numbers describes a narrative that claims to be situated in the Late Bronze Age,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.840
 maybe around the 15th century BCE. But Numbers itself, the book, was composed centuries later,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.079
 also during the Iron Age. So we're talking a span of hundreds of years between the supposed

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:23.160
 events of Numbers 22 and the date of composition of both the Deir Allah inscription and Numbers

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.760
 22. It's more likely that both of these texts are drawing on a local tradition about

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.959
 Balaam that was circulating east of the Jordan River in the 9th to 7th centuries BCE. The

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.040
 story in Numbers also seems to reflect the political reality of the Iron Age, when the

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.959
 Kingdom of Moab was a frequent rival of the Israelite kingdoms.

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:46.800
 So as Dr. Henry explained, it is possible that Balaam was in fact a real historical

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.319
 person. However, the extra-biblical source we have for him comes from the Iron Age, not

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:57.600
 the Bronze Age. So in other words, it's not a contemporary source. Or it could be

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.319
 that Balaam actually lived in the Iron Age and that the biblical authors simply placed

00:09:02.319 --> 00:09:08.079
 him further back in time. Either way, we can't give Balaam the same kind of verification

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:13.600
 that we can give to Shashank or Omri. Balaam's verification would be more at the level of

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.000
 David. Regardless, the Deir Allah inscription is an amazing find and does at least open

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.199
 the possibility that the Bible contains a reference to a real Bronze Age person who

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:29.680
 was important enough in the region that his name was remembered centuries later.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.360
 Let's now take a look at the most important biblical figure from the Bronze Age – Moses.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.399
 Is there any evidence in the archaeological record of him? Well, there's one particular

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:46.560
 inscription that some argue does in fact mention Moses. I'm going to let PhD candidate Lachlan

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.959
 Davis from the up-and-coming YouTube channel Tablets and Temples tell you more.

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:57.519
 This is the Sinai 361 inscription, one of several carved inscriptions discovered near

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:03.519
 an ancient mining site on the Sinai Peninsula. Bold claims have been made that these texts

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:10.000
 contain the name Moses as well as descriptions of events from the Exodus, such as Moses performing

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 miracles and creating a bronze serpent statue. The inscriptions date to the 2nd millennium

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.280
 BCE and are written in Proto-Sinaitic, the oldest known alphabetic script from which the Phoenician

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:29.920
 and Paleo-Hebrew alphabet is descended. So are these writings evidence for Moses and the Exodus?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.519
 One such advocate is Dr. Douglas Petrovich who translates the inscription as follows,

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:41.680
 Our bound servitude has lingered. Moses then provoked astonishment. It is a year of

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:48.160
 astonishment because of the lady. Such a reading evokes images of slavery and miracles performed

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.759
 by Moses in the book of Exodus. Another translation by Professor Kramalkov reads,

00:10:53.759 --> 00:11:01.920
 This is the site of where stood the snake of bronze that Mashae, meaning Moses, Mahub-Baalt made.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.920
 He argues this is a reference to the bronze serpent Moses created in the book of Numbers.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.519
 While these sensational claims are exciting, the reality is these translations have been

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:20.240
 heavily criticized and the texts likely don't say Moses at all. The Hebrew name Moses comes

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.639
 from the Egyptian word Messi, meaning to give birth, and has S as its middle letter. However,

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:31.840
 translators who found Moses in the Sinai inscriptions have mistaken a letter for the

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:40.800
 Phoenician s sound when it is actually a Sinaitic th letter, as in thin. So if the word is a name,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.759
 it's probably math, which means twin in Ugaritic. The scholar Dr. Aaron Wilson-Wright has demonstrated

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:54.399
 that these sensational Moses translations rely on restoring words that aren't in the inscription

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:59.840
 and inventing new meanings for other words. So she proposes the following translation,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.800
 O returner, those who tell people about math are beloved of the lady. The lady is the Egyptian

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:14.720
 goddess Hathor. This is a common expression among the Sinai inscriptions. Another text, Sinai 351

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.959
 reads, Beloved of the lady are those who tell people about math, the miner and extractor.

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:28.079
 And still another 349 calls math the chief of miners. It appears these inscriptions commemorate

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:35.040
 a mining official, possibly named math, and offer blessings from Hathor. The texts make no reference

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.280
 to Moses, snakes, or miracles, but they are a fascinating example of writing in the world's

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:48.480
 oldest alphabet and scholars are continuing to work on deciphering them. Okay, so maybe those

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.720
 inscriptions don't refer to Moses, but there's lots of other evidence for the Exodus, right?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.120
 Well, no. In recent years, several popular documentaries have come out which claim to go

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.560
 through lots of evidence for the Exodus, but in each case, the evidence presented is extremely

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.120
 flimsy and has not been verified by any actual experts. So for this topic, I'm going to let a

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.959
 real archaeologist, Raven De Silva from the channel Dig It with Raven, explain further.

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:23.199
 She has a new book coming out called The Other Ancient Civilizations,

00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:29.199
 decoding archaeology's less celebrated cultures, which I'll leave a link to in the description.

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:30.560
 Over to you, Raven.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.920
 Two stone pillars flank the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. Supposedly, they were erected by

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.360
 King Solomon to commemorate the crossing of the Red Sea by the Hebrews after they were freed by

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:48.639
 Moses. But are these pillars actual archaeological evidence of this biblical event? Let's get into it.

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:55.519
 In 1978, Ron Wyatt, an American nurse anesthetist and amateur archaeologist who claimed to have made

00:13:55.519 --> 00:14:02.879
 over 100 biblical archaeological discoveries, found a red granite pillar at the Egyptian side

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:09.600
 of the Gulf at Nuweiba. According to his report, it was found on its side in the water itself,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:16.160
 but today you can find it on the side of a road erected in concrete about 500 feet away from the

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.559
 beach. Wyatt said that there was supposedly an inscription or there should have been an

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:26.879
 inscription on this pillar that had since been eroded away, and he also said that it was of

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:33.120
 Hebrew or Phoenician origin and dated to around 3,000 years old. I tried to look at this pillar

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.759
 and date it off of the photos and biblical documentaries that are out there, but there

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:45.199
 aren't really many very detailed high quality images of this pillar, so it's really difficult

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:50.160
 to do so. I can't tell you how old it is with any confidence, but looking at the design of this

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:58.160
 pillar, I don't know about you, but it looks very non-descript to me. That means it could be from

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.639
 anywhere

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:03.359
 or any time throughout history, to be honest, unless we get a closer look at it

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:08.199
 and do some actual scientific research on it. The pillar doesn't have a capital, so

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:12.559
 that also doesn't really help in its identification. And when I think of

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:19.039
 Phoenician pillar, I think of this. Ron Wyatt himself did not do any scientific

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:22.559
 studies on it, from what I've seen, because there are no peer-reviewed

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:27.479
 papers out there to actually talk about any of his discoveries. So again, there's

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:33.079
 nothing firmly documenting it anywhere saying that it was from 3,000 years ago

00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:38.439
 and it is of this design. In 1984, Wyatt claimed that he found a second pillar

00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:43.119
 directly opposite Nuweiba on the opposite side of the Gulf in Saudi

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:48.759
 Arabia. It was apparently immediately removed by Saudi authorities, but it was

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:51.839
 apparently inscribed with the following words on it.

00:15:51.839 --> 00:16:00.319
 Yahweh, Pharaoh, Mizraim, or Egypt, Moses, Death, Water, Solomon, and Edom. In what

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:05.439
 context? Wyatt didn't say. He also didn't mention any fragments of words or other

00:16:05.439 --> 00:16:10.079
 words that maybe were, you know, connecting words or sentence words. And

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:13.279
 he didn't mention, like, the placement of the words or what context. There's no

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:17.119
 rubbing of the words or any photographic evidence of the words. So it all just

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:22.319
 seems very convenient and keyword-themed. It's almost like he was doing SEO for a

00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:25.759
 pillar. There's an extra layer of convenience as well because it was a

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:29.479
 mysterious pillar that was found and then it was swiftly taken away

00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:35.679
 immediately, only to have, like, a plaque in Saudi Arabia marking where it was. And

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:39.599
 that's literally the only physical remains that we have, is this, like, little

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:44.959
 commemorative plaque on the other side of the Red Sea. If Wyatt had taken any

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:50.319
 sort of photos of the pillar or, again, inscriptions, anything like that, then we

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:54.919
 could maybe talk about its legitimacy and a little bit more of the dating and

00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:59.919
 its connection to the one in Nuweiba. But until then, you know, it's one of those

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:03.679
 things where the jury's out and you won't be able to convince me until I see

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:08.239
 some hard scientific evidence. I also quickly want to point out that King

00:17:08.239 --> 00:17:14.399
 Solomon supposedly erected these pillars 400 years after the Red Sea crossing

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:18.359
 apparently happened. Even if he did erect these pillars, that doesn't

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:23.279
 actually mean that the crossing of the Red Sea happened. People erect religious

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:28.399
 monuments all the time, and if it was so long after it happened, it doesn't

00:17:28.399 --> 00:17:33.479
 actually confirm that this event took place. What I do find interesting is that

00:17:33.479 --> 00:17:38.479
 Ron and his sons found and photographed supposed coral-encrusted chariot pieces

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:43.679
 at the bottom of the Red Sea, as well as chariot wheels and bones belonging to

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:48.519
 both humans and horses. Apparently some of the wood that they found had gold

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:52.799
 gilding on it, but it was too deteriorated and fragile to actually be

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:57.799
 removed from the water for any further scientific study. Images of these finds

00:17:57.799 --> 00:18:02.639
 were shown to Dr. Nassif Mohamed Hassan, the director of Egyptian antiquities at

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:08.679
 the time, though whenever I google his name only biblical websites come up, so...

00:18:08.679 --> 00:18:13.239
 But Dr. Hassan claimed that one of the wheels was from the 18th dynasty,

00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:18.360
 apparently this is the only time that an eight-spoked wheel was used in ancient

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.239
 Egypt, which does include the reign of Rameses II. I'm not an expert in

00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:27.319
 Egyptian chariots, so I can't tell you, like, how many spokes were used for the

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:30.880
 wheels throughout all of Egyptian history, but I can show you an image of

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.880
 Rameses II in a chariot when he was fighting the Hittites. Overall there's

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:42.520
 just a lot of speculation and looking at something that could fit and making a

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.640
 claim without any sort of scientific evidence to back you up. Also, I'm sorry,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.840
 you can't look at this coral formation and immediately claim that it's an

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.660
 entire ancient set of chariot wheels still attached to its axle. All of the

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.239
 overlays on these bits of coral supposedly marking out all of the spokes

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:05.840
 on a wheel are just wild to me. I'm not an underwater archaeologist, but this

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.119
 just looks... it just doesn't look right. Doesn't look right at all. Apparently a

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:15.320
 human femur that Ron Wyatt found in the Red Sea was tested at Stockholm

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.380
 University and it was determined that it came from a man about 165 to 170

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.720
 centimeters tall, but from what I saw, there was no documentation stating

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.720
 actually how old it was. So again, it could have just been... it can just be a

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.959
 bone. It might have just been a bone that was in the sea from someone else at any

00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:40.679
 other point in history. Contrary to some beliefs, archaeology is in fact a science

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:46.839
 and we don't make any conclusions unless there is irrefutable evidence that has

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:52.079
 been checked multiple times by varying methods. So until there are proper

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:58.559
 archaeological tests, surveys, excavations, to me the Pillar of Solomon will remain

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:03.999
 simply a pillar in my eyes and all of the coral remains underneath the water

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:11.359
 will simply be a rich, biodiverse home for sea life. So yeah, this all boils down

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:17.319
 to how archaeology actually works in the real world. You can't just say, oh I found

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:22.559
 this thing but oops I didn't take photos and now it's gone. Or I think these

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:28.399
 fuzzy photos kind of look like wheels, but no expert has ever seemed bothered

00:20:28.399 --> 00:20:33.119
 to take a closer look at them. Even though the government of Egypt makes lots of

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:37.159
 money off tourism and is usually more than willing to examine just about

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:42.359
 anything if they think it is legitimate. So the bottom line is, major discoveries

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:48.279
 are always reported in peer-reviewed journals so that other experts can chime

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:53.999
 in and either debate things or verify things. They are not announced via

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:59.239
 commercially made documentaries. This general principle can be applied to lots

00:20:59.239 --> 00:21:04.199
 more ridiculous claims that biblical literalists make, such as that this

00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:09.919
 structure in Turkey is Noah's Ark or that this statue is Joseph because it

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:14.079
 comes from around the right time and place and the figure appears to be

00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:19.359
 wearing a multi-colored coat. But just because something seems to fit the

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:24.039
 biblical narrative, it doesn't automatically mean that it does. Okay, so

00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:27.839
 when it comes to Moses and the Exodus story, there is currently no

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:33.039
 archaeological evidence that points to a person like the Bible describes or an

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:37.679
 event like the Bible describes. Now that doesn't mean that there was definitely

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:43.479
 no Moses-like person. Probably the story is based on something. But it's safe to

00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:47.919
 assume that the biblical version of Moses and the Exodus is more literature

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:53.879
 than it is literal history. But what about the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:58.359
 Jacob? When it comes to them, there's a claim out there that goes far beyond

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:03.279
 just finding their names etched into stones. In this case, some people believe

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:08.959
 that we actually know their precise burial place. Muslims, in particular,

00:22:08.959 --> 00:22:14.479
 believe that at this site in Hebron, known as the Cave of the Patriarchs, lay

00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:19.799
 not only the actual bones of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob but of Adam and Eve as

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:25.479
 well. I'll let the Useful Charts animator, Siawish Raymond, who also hosts the

00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:31.879
 Islamic History Channel, Al-Muqaddimah, explain. In 638 CE, the Holy Land came

00:22:31.879 --> 00:22:36.919
 under the control of the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam. The

00:22:36.919 --> 00:22:41.639
 Rashidun Caliphate, under Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab, conquered cities like

00:22:41.639 --> 00:22:47.119
 Jerusalem, Gaza, and Hebron which marked the transfer of the biblical holy sites,

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:52.919
 many of which are holy to Muslims, Jews, and Christians to Muslims. While the

00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:57.559
 Caliphate didn't persecute religious minorities and even protected many of

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:02.519
 their sacred sites, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, many other sites were

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:08.279
 converted to the Islamic tradition and made into mosques. Among these newly

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:13.239
 Islamized mosques was the Ibrahimi Mosque which was previously a Byzantine

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:19.399
 era basilica enclosed in a Herodian era complex. This complex was built shortly

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:25.039
 before the birth of Jesus on top of a cave known as the Cave of the Patriarchs.

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:29.599
 It's called that because according to the traditions of Judaism, Christianity,

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:35.079
 and Islam, this is where the patriarchs and their wives are buried. It's said that

00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:39.839
 the patriarch Abraham, known as Ibrahim in Islam, bought this cave when his wife

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:46.479
 Sarah passed away. Then Abraham, his son Isaac, and Isaac's son Jacob were buried

00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:51.939
 along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah respectively. According to some

00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:57.519
 sources, Adam and Eve are buried there as well. The complex that we see today was

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:03.479
 built by King Herod the Great of Judea shortly before Jesus was born. However,

00:24:03.479 --> 00:24:08.479
 Josephus, who wrote so much about Herod's construction projects, doesn't give him

00:24:08.479 --> 00:24:13.919
 credit for the complex. In 2020, a paper was published that mentioned pottery

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:19.239
 found at the site from multiple cities that dated as far back as the 8th

00:24:19.239 --> 00:24:24.919
 century BCE. This puts the site as a location that was visited by people

00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:29.759
 maybe from all over the Holy Land as far back as during the days of the Kingdom

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:35.599
 of Judah. The Babylonian exile was still some two centuries in the future at this

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:41.039
 point. What we know as Judaism today, which is in fact Rabbinic Judaism, didn't

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:46.359
 exist in its current form at all. However, while the 8th century BCE is

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:52.099
 quite far back, it's still around 1,000 years after Abraham is supposed to have

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:58.159
 lived, which is around 1800 BCE or so. Now, according to the vast majority of

00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:03.639
 academic scholars, Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are purely mythological

00:25:03.639 --> 00:25:09.679
 characters and did not, in fact, exist. Since they didn't exist, their burial

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:15.039
 sites didn't exist either. However, this didn't stop people from claiming to have

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:19.359
 found bones down there. During the Islamic era, it was forbidden to go into

00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:24.639
 the caves below the complex as a form of respect for the patriarchs. However, there

00:25:24.639 --> 00:25:29.879
 was a brief period of around a century, the 12th century to be precise, when the

00:25:29.879 --> 00:25:34.519
 Holy Land was under Christian control, after the First Crusade. During this

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:39.399
 period, the caves were more accessible and a monk claimed to have found bones

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:43.799
 there. Although many sites around the world claim to be burial sites for

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:48.719
 various biblical and Quranic figures, there are even multiple places claiming

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:53.919
 to be the burial place of the same person. So, the whole thing isn't very

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:59.719
 scientific. Okay, so it's safe to say that the traceable activity at the Cave of the

00:25:59.719 --> 00:26:04.559
 Patriarch site goes no further back than the Iron Age, even though it

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:09.439
 supposedly contains the remains of people from the Bronze Age. So, unless

00:26:09.439 --> 00:26:14.559
 someone opens the tombs and tests the supposed bones in there, this site

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:19.119
 cannot be used as evidence for the existence of any biblical character. And

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:24.759
 the same goes for the plethora of other sites, most of which are Islamic, which

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:29.479
 claim to hold the bones of other biblical characters, such as Abel, Noah,

00:26:29.479 --> 00:26:35.399
 and Moses. Okay, so I'm actually going to end this video on a positive note. That's

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:39.679
 because there is one particular figure from the Bronze Age, for whom we have

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:43.999
 lots of contemporary evidence for, that might actually be mentioned by name in

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:49.159
 the Bible. So, this is not a central biblical character, but rather a foreign

00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:54.079
 figure that is maybe mentioned in passing in the biblical text. In fact,

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:59.079
 it's a Bronze Age figure whose name is very well known, Hammurabi, King of

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:04.879
 Babylon. So, obviously, for this last segment, I had to ask a seriologist, Dr.

00:27:04.879 --> 00:27:10.959
 Joshua Bowen, from the channel Digital Hammurabi, for his thoughts. In Genesis

00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:18.199
 14.1, we read, Now in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Ariak, king of Elisar,

00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:27.799
 Kedor-la-Omer, king of Elam, and Tigal, king of Goyim. Who are these kings? Because

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:31.719
 Shinar is known to be another name for the land of Babylonia in the Hebrew

00:27:31.719 --> 00:27:36.879
 Bible, this led scholars to look for a Babylonian king, with whom to identify

00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:43.719
 the first king, Amraphel. In the late 19th century, this king of Shinar was

00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:48.919
 identified as Hammurabi, assuming that the Akkadian form of his name had been

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:54.759
 confused when brought into the Hebrew text. However, scholars later moved away

00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:59.759
 from this view. A significant development came with the publication of three

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:04.799
 relatively late cuneiform texts that were likely copied from earlier texts

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:10.959
 during the early 1st millennium BCE, known as the Spartoli tablets. These

00:28:10.959 --> 00:28:17.119
 texts described four kings who fought against the city of Babylon. In the late

00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:22.919
 19th century, Pinchas, the scholar who published the tablets, read the name of

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:30.719
 one of the kings as Kedor-la-Hamal, or Kedor-la-Gamal, and made a connection

00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:37.759
 between this name and the Kedor-la-Omer of Genesis 14. This led to scholars

00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:41.879
 looking at the names of the other kings in the Spartoli tablets to see if they

00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:47.919
 could make other connections to those in Genesis 14. In the tablets, the king of

00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:54.199
 Babylonia was named Ibil-Tutu, and it was argued that this name referred to the

00:28:54.199 --> 00:29:01.199
 Babylonian usurper Marduk-apla-Idana. The name Marduk is written in Sumerian

00:29:01.199 --> 00:29:07.599
 Amar-Utu, and it was theorized that the writer of the biblical texts had at his

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:14.119
 disposal a shortened form of Marduk-apla-Idana's name, which consisted of the

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:23.239
 Amar of Amar-Utu, and Apal, thus Amar-Apal, which found its way into the Hebrew

00:29:23.239 --> 00:29:29.799
 text as Amraphel. Recently, in a monograph about the history of the city

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:35.039
 of Babylon, Stephanie Dally presented the current opinions on this passage in an

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:40.759
 appendix entitled Genesis 14 1 through 16 and possible links with foreign

00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:47.159
 rulers early in the reign of Hammurabi. There she notes that although scholars

00:29:47.159 --> 00:29:51.639
 abandoned the early notion that Genesis 14 referred to kings from the time of

00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:56.239
 Hammurabi, this has again come back to be a tenable position.

00:29:56.239 --> 00:30:05.199
 the name Amraphel, she writes, either Hammurabi with an unexplained suffix l or Amudpl, king of

00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:12.399
 Katna, with the common misreading of the letter r for d, possibly a confusion of the two names.

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:17.199
 Although research in the last two decades, particularly from material from the time of

00:30:17.199 --> 00:30:23.919
 Hammurabi at the city of Mari, has moved scholars back toward identifying the Genesis 14 names,

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:29.919
 including Amraphel, king of Shinar, with kings from the time of Hammurabi, it would appear that

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:36.719
 we still do not possess enough information to draw definitive conclusions. Okay, so that's a

00:30:36.719 --> 00:30:44.319
 maybe and a very interesting one at that. If the Amraphel mentioned in Genesis 14 is in fact a

00:30:44.319 --> 00:30:51.119
 reference to the great king Hammurabi of Babylon, then that means that Hammurabi is the oldest known

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:58.079
 historical figure mentioned by name in the Bible. And it also means that we have verification for at

00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:04.959
 least one Bronze Age person. Now, it actually makes sense that Hammurabi's name in particular

00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:11.599
 might have found its way into the Bible. According to critical scholars, Genesis 14 was most likely

00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:19.199
 written during the Babylonian captivity, which took place following 586 BCE. Being that Hammurabi

00:31:19.199 --> 00:31:24.479
 was one of the most famous Babylonian kings of all time, it's not hard to believe that the

00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:29.519
 Judahite scribes living in Babylon during the 500s might have heard about him and might have

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:35.599
 decided to work him into their nation's origin story. So, the conclusion is still that there is

00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:40.959
 a huge difference when it comes to the Bronze Age parts of the Bible and the Iron Age parts.

00:31:40.959 --> 00:31:46.959
 The names of the main characters from the Iron Age section are relatively easy to find in the

00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:51.359
 archaeological record, whereas the names of the main characters from the Bronze Age section

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:58.319
 are not. Likewise, the Iron Age parts contain lots of references to foreign individuals, who are known

00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:04.879
 to be real historical people, whereas the Bronze Age parts have, at best, just two references.

00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:10.479
 Okay, so that was a look at the Bible and the Bronze Age. Special thanks to all my fellow
