            <p>Hi, this is Matt Baker. About a year ago, we posted a video called 37 Bible Characters Found Through Archaeology. In that video, I emphasized the fact that all 37 of those people, indicated here with a verification checkmark, lived during the Iron Age or later. This is because the Bible is basically an Iron Age book, meaning that it was during the Iron Age that the Bible started to be written. To put it another way, by the time the biblical authors put ink to parchment, the Bronze Age was already a distant memory and therefore they had to rely on a lot of guesswork, mixed with imagination, to come up with stories from earlier times. Which is why Genesis and Exodus read more like myth and legend than, say, 2 Kings, which includes a lot of historical details that nicely line up with what we know from other sources.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Now, while critical scholars are all basically in agreement about all of this, there are still some people from certain religious circles who continue to believe that the Bible is 100% literal history. These people sometimes cite certain archaeological finds as evidence for biblical characters from the Bronze Age. Therefore, in today's video, I'm going to take a look at some of these claims and I'm going to do so with the help of Religion for Breakfast, Tablets and Temples, Dig It With Raven, Al-Muqaddimah, and Digital Hammurabi.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Let's begin by taking a closer look at where the division between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age occurs on our Biblical family tree chart. Basically, the dividing line would look something like this. So, characters such as the Three Patriarchs, as well as Moses, all belong in the Bronze Age, whereas characters like Devorah, Ruth, David, and Samuel belong in the Early Iron Age. As mentioned in our previous video, the earliest Israelite leader for whom we have a contemporary extra-biblical source for is Omri. We do have an earlier mention of David outside of the Bible but it's not actually from a contemporary source as it only mentions him as being the ancestor of a later king. So if we want a contemporary source, then no, we don't actually have anything for David.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>However, when it comes to non-Israelites mentioned by name in the Bible, we do have someone even earlier than Omri and that is Shoshenq I. Being that he was a pharaoh of Egypt, we have lots of contemporary extra-biblical sources for him. Okay, so the goal of this video is to see if we can get a verification checkmark for anyone even earlier than Shoshenq and in particular, someone on the Bronze Age side of this big blue line.

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So let's start with who I think is the best possible candidate for making this happen. He's not actually shown on this family tree chart but if he was, he'd be placed somewhere here as a contemporary of Moses. I'll let Dr. Andrew Mark Henry from Religion for Breakfast explain more. Balaam son of Beor is one of the more mysterious figures in the Bible, a non-Israelite prophet who does the bidding of the God of Israel, only to be later cast as a villain and killed by the Israelites. He appears in the book of Numbers chapter 22.

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>The Israelites are nearing the end of their 40-year wander through the wilderness after escaping from Egypt and they're camped on the plains of Moab, just northeast of the Dead Sea in modern-day Jordan. And the Moabites are understandably alarmed. The Israelites have just destroyed a few of their neighbors and the Moabites are afraid that they're next. So the king of Moab decides to hire Balaam, who was famous for his very effective blessings and curses. Maybe with some supernatural help, with Balaam cursing the Israelites, the Moabites can properly defend themselves.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>While Balaam journeys to Moab on a donkey, God grows angry with him and sends an angel to block his path. The donkey can see the angel; Balaam can't, and while Balaam is striking the donkey trying to get it to move, the donkey starts talking and is like, "Hey, why are you doing this to me?" Finally, Balaam sees the angel of the Lord who says, "You can go to the Moabites but speak only what I tell you to speak." And so when Balaam arrives, instead of cursing the Israelites, he blesses them in a series of four poetic oracles.

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Now up until the 1960s, that's basically all we knew about Balaam, along with a few other passing references in the Bible. But in 1967, archaeologists discovered an inscription on a few pieces of plaster at an archaeological site called Deir Allah. The Deir Allah inscription dates to around 800 BCE and it's written in a Canaanite dialect with some similarities with Aramaic. It starts: "This is the book of Balaam son of Beor, a seer of the gods. The gods came to him at night and he beheld a vision in accordance with El's utterance."
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So here we have an extra-biblical reference to a seer named Balaam. Critical scholars agree that this is referencing the same character that we see in Numbers. The text describes the chief god of the Canaanite pantheon, El, coming to him with a message of disaster: The gods have banded together. The Shaddai gods have established a council and they have said to the god of Shagar: So up close up the heavens with a dense cloud that darkness exists there not brilliance.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So Balaam learns of a plan from the Shaddain—some sort of divine council of gods who oppose the chief god El—and they're planning to blanket the land in darkness. The text, as you can see, is very fragmentary but it seems that Balaam successfully averts the Shaddain's plan.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>The story in Numbers and the Deir Allah inscription demonstrate that Balaam was a known character in the region east of the Jordan River. Now some scholars think he was a historical figure—some sort of wandering prophet for hire—but at the very least this is evidence of a shared tradition in the region about a heavily mythologized celebrity prophet.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>When we compare this inscription with the Book of Numbers we can see how Israelite religion was embedded in the local cultural context and has affinities with other religious traditions in the region. In the Deir Allah inscription Balaam is a prophet for the chief god El; and in several instances in his oracles in the Book of Numbers he refers to the god of Israel as El.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>We see something similar with the council of gods in the Deir Allah inscription called the Shaddain. Shaddain is a plural form of the word Shaddai which appears in Balaam's oracles referencing the Israelite god—the oracle of Balaam who hears the words of El who sees the vision of Shaddai—usually translated as God and The Almighty respectively. And narratively speaking scholars have pointed out similarities between the story in Numbers and the inscription. Both include poetic oracles; and both include the plot point of having a vision at night that's then reported next morning.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Scholars argue that this means the story in Numbers knows what a Balaam story should sound like—in other words if Balaam is a stock character in local folklore then it would have been a literary convention to include a nocturnal vision. So scholars generally agree that Deir Allah inscription—and at least parts of story in Numbers—derive from same cultural context though repackaged for different audiences.

        </div>
        

    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Now none of this proves historicity of story in Numbers—the Deir Allah inscription dates to Iron Age around 800 BCE; Book of Numbers describes narrative that claims to be situated in Late Bronze Age maybe around 15th century BCE; but Numbers itself book composed centuries later also during Iron Age—so we're talking span hundreds years between supposed events Numbers 22 date composition both Deir Allah inscription Numbers 22—it's more likely both these texts drawing on local tradition about Balaam circulating east Jordan River in 9th-7th centuries BCE.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>The story in Numbers also seems to reflect political reality Iron Age when Kingdom Moab frequent rival Israelite kingdoms—so as Dr Henry explained it possible Balaam fact real historical person however extra-biblical source comes Iron Age not Bronze Age—in other words it's not contemporary source—or could be Balaam actually lived Iron Age biblical authors simply placed further back time—either way we can't give Balaam same kind verification can give Shashank Omri—Balaam's verification more level David.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>For any time throughout history, to be honest, unless we get a closer look at it and do some actual scientific research on it. The pillar doesn't have a capital, so that also doesn't really help in its identification. And when I think of Phoenician pillar, I think of this. Ron Wyatt himself did not do any scientific studies on it, from what I've seen, because there are no peer-reviewed papers out there to actually talk about any of his discoveries. So again, there's nothing firmly documenting it anywhere saying that it was from 3,000 years ago and it is of this design.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>In 1984, Wyatt claimed that he found a second pillar directly opposite Nuweiba on the opposite side of the Gulf in Saudi Arabia. It was apparently immediately removed by Saudi authorities, but it was apparently inscribed with the following words on it: Yahweh, Pharaoh, Mizraim, or Egypt, Moses, Death, Water, Solomon, and Edom. In what context? Wyatt didn't say. He also didn't mention any fragments of words or other words that maybe were, you know, connecting words or sentence words. And he didn't mention, like, the placement of the words or what context. There's no rubbing of the words or any photographic evidence of the words. So it all just seems very convenient and keyword-themed.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>It's almost like he was doing SEO for a pillar. There's an extra layer of convenience as well because it was a mysterious pillar that was found and then it was swiftly taken away immediately, only to have, like, a plaque in Saudi Arabia marking where it was. And that's literally the only physical remains that we have, is this, like, little commemorative plaque on the other side of the Red Sea. If Wyatt had taken any sort of photos of the pillar or, again, inscriptions, anything like that, then we could maybe talk about its legitimacy and a little bit more of the dating and its connection to the one in Nuweiba. But until then, you know, it's one of those things where the jury's out and you won't be able to convince me until I see some hard scientific evidence.

            <p>I also quickly want to point out that King Solomon supposedly erected these pillars 400 years after the Red Sea crossing apparently happened. Even if he did erect these pillars, that doesn't actually mean that the crossing of the Red Sea happened. People erect religious monuments all the time, and if it was so long after it happened, it doesn't actually confirm that this event took place.

            <p>What I do find interesting is that Ron and his sons found and photographed supposed coral-encrusted chariot pieces at the bottom of the Red Sea, as well as chariot wheels and bones belonging to both humans and horses. Apparently some of the wood that they found had gold gilding on it, but it was too deteriorated and fragile to actually be removed from the water for any further scientific study. Images of these finds were shown to Dr. Nassif Mohamed Hassan, the director of Egyptian antiquities at the time, though whenever I google his name only biblical websites come up, so... But Dr. Hassan claimed that one of the wheels was from the 18th dynasty, apparently this is the only time that an eight-spoked wheel was used in ancient Egypt, which does include the reign of Rameses II.

            <p>I'm not an expert in Egyptian chariots, so I can't tell you, like, how many spokes were used for the wheels throughout all of Egyptian history, but I can show you an image of Rameses II in a chariot when he was fighting the Hittites. Overall there's just a lot of speculation and looking at something that could fit and making a claim without any sort of scientific evidence to back you up.

            <p>Also, I'm sorry, you can't look at this coral formation and immediately claim that it's an entire ancient set of chariot wheels still attached to its axle. All of the overlays on these bits of coral supposedly marking out all of the spokes on a wheel are just wild to me. I'm not an underwater archaeologist, but this just looks... it just doesn't look right. Doesn't look right at all. Apparently a human femur that Ron Wyatt found in the Red Sea was tested at Stockholm University and it was determined that it came from a man about 165 to 170 centimeters tall, but from what I saw, there was no documentation stating actually how old it was.

            <p>So again, it could have just been... it can just be a bone. It might have just been a bone that was in the sea from someone else at any other point in history. Contrary to some beliefs, archaeology is in fact a science and we don't make any conclusions unless there is irrefutable evidence that has been checked multiple times by varying methods.

            <p>So until there are proper archaeological tests, surveys, excavations, to me the Pillar of Solomon will remain simply a pillar in my eyes and all of the coral remains underneath the water will simply be a rich, biodiverse home for sea life. So yeah, this all boils down to how archaeology actually works in the real world. You can't just say oh I found this thing but oops I didn't take photos and now it's gone. Or I think these fuzzy photos kind of look like wheels, but no expert has ever seemed bothered to take a closer look at them.

            <p>Even though the government of Egypt makes lots of money off tourism and is usually more than willing to examine just about anything if they think it is legitimate. So the bottom line is, major discoveries are always reported in peer-reviewed journals so that other experts can chime in and either debate things or verify things. They are not announced via commercially made documentaries.

But just because something seems to fit the biblical narrative, it doesn't automatically mean that it does.

Now that doesn't mean that there was definitely no Moses-like person. Probably the story is based on something. But it's safe to assume that the biblical version of Moses and the Exodus is more literature than it is literal history.

            <p>But what about the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? When it comes to them, there's a claim out there that goes far beyond just finding their names etched into stones. In this case, some people believe that we actually know their precise burial place. Muslims, in particular, believe that at this site in Hebron, known as the Cave of the Patriarchs lay not only the actual bones of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob but of Adam and Eve as well.

            <p>I'll let the Useful Charts animator, Siawish Raymond, who also hosts the Islamic History Channel Al-Muqaddimah explain. In 638 CE, the Holy Land came under control of the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions Islam. The Rashidun Caliphate under Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab conquered cities like Jerusalem Gaza and Hebron which marked the transfer of biblical holy sites many of which are holy to Muslims Jews and Christians to Muslims.

            <p>The name Amraphel, she writes, either Hammurabi with an unexplained suffix "l" or Amudpl, king of Katna, with the common misreading of the letter "r" for "d," possibly a confusion of the two names. Although research in the last two decades, particularly from material from the time of Hammurabi at the city of Mari, has moved scholars back toward identifying the Genesis 14 names, including Amraphel, king of Shinar, with kings from the time of Hammurabi, it would appear that we still do not possess enough information to draw definitive conclusions.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Okay, so that's a maybe and a very interesting one at that. If the Amraphel mentioned in Genesis 14 is in fact a reference to the great king Hammurabi of Babylon, then that means that Hammurabi is the oldest known historical figure mentioned by name in the Bible. And it also means that we have verification for at least one Bronze Age person.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Now, it actually makes sense that Hammurabi's name in particular might have found its way into the Bible. According to critical scholars, Genesis 14 was most likely written during the Babylonian captivity, which took place following 586 BCE. Being that Hammurabi was one of the most famous Babylonian kings of all time, it's not hard to believe that the Judahite scribes living in Babylon during the 500s might have heard about him and might have decided to work him into their nation's origin story.

            <p>So, the conclusion is still that there is a huge difference when it comes to the Bronze Age parts of the Bible and the Iron Age parts. The names of the main characters from the Iron Age section are relatively easy to find in the archaeological record, whereas the names of the main characters from the Bronze Age section are not. Likewise, the Iron Age parts contain lots of references to foreign individuals who are known to be real historical people, whereas the Bronze Age parts have, at best, just two references.
