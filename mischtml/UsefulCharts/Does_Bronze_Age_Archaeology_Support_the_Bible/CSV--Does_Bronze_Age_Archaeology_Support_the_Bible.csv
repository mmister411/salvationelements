0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.559,4.559999942779541," Hi, this is Matt Baker. About a year ago, we posted a video called"
1,00:00:04.559,00:00:10.319,5.759999752044678," 37 Bible Characters Found Through Archaeology. In that video, I emphasized the fact that"
2,00:00:10.319,00:00:15.920,5.600000381469727," all 37 of those people, indicated here with a verification checkmark, lived during the"
3,00:00:15.920,00:00:22.100,6.180000305175781," Iron Age or later. This is because the Bible is basically an Iron Age book, meaning that"
4,00:00:22.100,00:00:25.319,3.219999313354492, it was during the Iron Age that the Bible started to be written.
5,00:00:25.319,00:00:30.760,5.440000534057617," To put it another way, by the time the biblical authors put ink to parchment, the Bronze Age"
6,00:00:30.760,00:00:36.000,5.239999771118164," was already a distant memory and therefore they had to rely on a lot of guesswork, mixed"
7,00:00:36.000,00:00:41.880,5.880001068115234," with imagination, to come up with stories from earlier times. Which is why Genesis and"
8,00:00:41.880,00:00:48.360,6.479999542236328," Exodus read more like myth and legend than, say, 2 Kings, which includes a lot of historical"
9,00:00:48.360,00:00:52.479,4.119998931884766, details that nicely line up with what we know from other sources.
10,00:00:52.479,00:00:57.240,4.760002136230469," Now, while critical scholars are all basically in agreement about all of this, there are"
11,00:00:57.240,00:01:02.400,5.159999847412109, still some people from certain religious circles who continue to believe that the Bible is
12,00:01:02.400,00:01:09.119,6.719997406005859, 100% literal history. These people sometimes cite certain archaeological finds as evidence
13,00:01:09.119,00:01:13.719,4.599998474121094," for biblical characters from the Bronze Age. Therefore, in today's video, I'm going"
14,00:01:13.719,00:01:18.479,4.760002136230469, to take a look at some of these claims and I'm going to do so with the help of Religion

27,00:02:27.160,00:02:33.200,6.0399932861328125," Alright, back to the Bronze Age. Let's begin by taking a closer look at where the division"
28,00:02:33.200,00:02:38.800,5.600006103515625," between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age occurs on our Biblical family tree chart. Basically,"
29,00:02:38.800,00:02:45.200,6.4000091552734375," the dividing line would look something like this. So, characters such as the Three Patriarchs,"
30,00:02:45.200,00:02:50.600,5.399993896484375," as well as Moses, all belong in the Bronze Age, whereas characters like Devorah, Ruth,"
31,00:02:50.600,00:02:54.640,4.040008544921875," David, and Samuel belong in the Early Iron Age."
32,00:02:54.640,00:03:00.900,6.2599945068359375," As mentioned in our previous video, the earliest Israelite leader for whom we have a contemporary"
33,00:03:00.900,00:03:07.800,6.899993896484375, extra-biblical source for is Omri. We do have an earlier mention of David outside of the
34,00:03:07.800,00:03:13.479,5.67999267578125, Bible but it's not actually from a contemporary source as it only mentions him as being the
35,00:03:13.479,00:03:19.880,6.4000091552734375," ancestor of a later king. So if we want a contemporary source, then no, we don't actually"
36,00:03:19.880,00:03:25.200,5.3199920654296875," have anything for David. However, when it comes to non-Israelites mentioned by name"
37,00:03:25.200,00:03:32.080,6.8800048828125," in the Bible, we do have someone even earlier than Omri and that is Shoshenq I. Being that"
38,00:03:32.080,00:03:38.360,6.279998779296875," he was a pharaoh of Egypt, we have lots of contemporary extra-biblical sources for him."
39,00:03:38.360,00:03:43.360,5.0," Okay, so the goal of this video is to see if we can get a verification checkmark for"
40,00:03:43.360,00:03:50.160,6.8000030517578125," anyone even earlier than Shoshenq and in particular, someone on the Bronze Age side of this big"
41,00:03:50.160,00:03:55.560,5.399993896484375, blue line. So let's start with who I think is the best possible candidate for making
42,00:03:55.560,00:04:00.520,4.9600067138671875," this happen. He's not actually shown on this family tree chart but if he was, he'd"
43,00:04:00.520,00:04:06.880,6.3600006103515625, be placed somewhere here as a contemporary of Moses. I'll let Dr. Andrew Mark Henry
44,00:04:06.880,00:04:10.360,3.4799957275390625, from Religion for Breakfast explain more.
45,00:04:10.360,00:04:15.040,4.6800079345703125," Balaam son of Beor is one of the more mysterious figures in the Bible, a non-Israelite prophet"
46,00:04:15.040,00:04:19.679,4.639984130859375," who does the bidding of the God of Israel, only to be later cast as a villain and killed"
47,00:04:19.679,00:04:24.040,4.360015869140625, by the Israelites. He appears in the book of Numbers chapter 22. The Israelites are
48,00:04:24.040,00:04:27.959,3.91998291015625, nearing the end of their 40-year wander through the wilderness after escaping from Egypt and
49,00:04:27.959,00:04:32.679,4.720001220703125," they're camped on the plains of Moab, just northeast of the Dead Sea in modern-day Jordan."
50,00:04:32.679,00:04:37.239,4.55999755859375, And the Moabites are understandably alarmed. The Israelites have just destroyed a few of
51,00:04:37.239,00:04:41.239,4.0, their neighbors and the Moabites are afraid that they're next. So the king of Moab decides
52,00:04:41.239,00:04:46.560,5.32000732421875," to hire Balaam, who was famous for his very effective blessings and curses. Maybe with"
53,00:04:46.560,00:04:51.040,4.480010986328125," some supernatural help, with Balaam cursing the Israelites, the Moabites can properly"
54,00:04:51.040,00:04:55.799,4.759979248046875," defend themselves. While Balaam journeys to Moab on a donkey, God grows angry with him"
55,00:04:55.799,00:05:00.679,4.8800048828125," and sends an angel to block his path. The donkey can see the angel, Balaam can't, and"
56,00:05:00.679,00:05:04.760,4.08001708984375," while Balaam is striking the donkey trying to get it to move, the donkey starts talking"
57,00:05:04.760,00:05:08.519,3.759979248046875," and is like, hey, why are you doing this to me? Finally, Balaam sees the angel of the"
58,00:05:08.519,00:05:12.920,4.4000244140625," Lord who says, you can go to the Moabites, but speak only what I tell you to speak. And"
59,00:05:12.920,00:05:17.600,4.67999267578125," so when Balaam arrives, instead of cursing the Israelites, he blesses them in a series"
60,00:05:17.600,00:05:23.480,5.8800048828125," of four poetic oracles. Now up until the 1960s, that's basically all we knew about Balaam,"
61,00:05:23.480,00:05:28.040,4.55999755859375," along with a few other passing references in the Bible. But in 1967, archaeologists"
62,00:05:28.040,00:05:32.119,4.079986572265625, discovered an inscription on a few pieces of plaster at an archaeological site called
63,00:05:32.119,00:05:37.640,5.52001953125," Deir Allah. The Deir Allah inscription dates to around 800 BCE, and it's written in a Canaanite"
64,00:05:37.640,00:05:40.840,3.199981689453125," dialect with some similarities with Aramaic. It starts,"
65,00:05:40.840,00:05:46.000,5.160003662109375," This is the book of Balaam, son of Beor, a seer of the gods. The gods came to him at"
66,00:05:46.000,00:05:50.119,4.1199951171875," night, and he beheld a vision in accordance with El's utterance."
67,00:05:50.119,00:05:54.119,4.0, So here we have an extra biblical reference to a seer named Balaam. Critical scholars
68,00:05:54.119,00:05:58.480,4.360015869140625, agree that this is referencing the same character that we see in Numbers. The text describes
69,00:05:58.480,00:06:02.679,4.199981689453125," the chief god of the Canaanite pantheon, El, coming to him with a message of disaster."
70,00:06:02.679,00:06:06.720,4.040008544921875," The gods have banded together. The Shaddai gods have established a council, and they"
71,00:06:06.720,00:06:11.880,5.160003662109375," have said to the god of Shagar, So up, close up the heavens with a dense cloud. That darkness"
72,00:06:11.880,00:06:17.060,5.17999267578125," exists there, not brilliance. So Balaam learns of a plan from the Shaddain, some sort of"
73,00:06:17.060,00:06:21.959,4.899993896484375," divine council of gods who oppose the chief god El, and they're planning to blanket the"
74,00:06:21.959,00:06:26.560,4.600006103515625," land in darkness. The text, as you can see, is very fragmentary, but it seems that Balaam"
75,00:06:26.560,00:06:31.480,4.920013427734375, successfully averts the Shaddain's plan. The story in Numbers and the Deir Allah inscription
76,00:06:31.480,00:06:36.160,4.67999267578125," demonstrate that Balaam was a known character in the region east of the Jordan River. Now,"
77,00:06:36.160,00:06:40.360,4.20001220703125," some scholars think he was a historical figure, some sort of wandering prophet for hire, but"
78,00:06:40.360,00:06:45.040,4.67999267578125," at the very least, this is evidence of a shared tradition in the region about a heavily mythologized"
79,00:06:45.040,00:06:49.799,4.759979248046875," celebrity prophet. When we compare this inscription with the Book of Numbers, we can see how Israelite"
80,00:06:49.799,00:06:54.899,5.100006103515625, religion was embedded in the local cultural context and has affinities with other religious
81,00:06:54.899,00:06:58.700,3.800018310546875," traditions in the region. In the Deir Allah inscription, Balaam is a prophet for the chief"
82,00:06:58.700,00:07:03.700,5.0," god El, and in several instances in his oracles in the Book of Numbers, he refers to the god"
83,00:07:03.700,00:07:07.860,4.160003662109375, of Israel as El. We see something similar with the council of gods in the Deir Allah
84,00:07:07.860,00:07:12.420,4.55999755859375," inscription called the Shaddain. Shaddain is a plural form of the word Shaddai, which"
85,00:07:12.420,00:07:17.299,4.879974365234375," appears in Balaam's oracles referencing the Israelite god, the oracle of Balaam who hears"
86,00:07:17.299,00:07:22.299,5.0," the words of El, who sees the vision of the Shaddai, usually translated as God and the"
87,00:07:22.299,00:07:26.820,4.52001953125," Almighty respectively. And narratively speaking, scholars have pointed out similarities between"
88,00:07:26.820,00:07:30.980,4.160003662109375," the story in Numbers and the inscription. Both include poetic oracles, and both include"
89,00:07:30.980,00:07:35.220,4.239990234375, the plot point of having a vision at night that's then reported the next morning. Scholars
90,00:07:35.220,00:07:39.220,4.0, argue that this means the story in Numbers knows what a Balaam story should sound like.
91,00:07:39.220,00:07:42.780,3.55999755859375," In other words, if Balaam is a stock character in the local folklore, then it would have"
92,00:07:42.780,00:07:47.579,4.79998779296875, been a literary convention to include a nocturnal vision. So scholars generally agree that the
93,00:07:47.579,00:07:52.340,4.760009765625," Deir Allah inscription, and at least parts of the story in Numbers, derive from the same"
94,00:07:52.340,00:07:57.920,5.58001708984375," cultural context, though repackaged for different audiences. Now, none of this proves the historicity"
95,00:07:57.920,00:08:03.799,5.879974365234375," of the story in Numbers. The Deir Allah inscription dates to the Iron Age, around 800 BCE. The"
96,00:08:03.799,00:08:08.320,4.52001953125," Book of Numbers describes a narrative that claims to be situated in the Late Bronze Age,"
97,00:08:08.320,00:08:13.840,5.519989013671875," maybe around the 15th century BCE. But Numbers itself, the book, was composed centuries later,"
98,00:08:13.840,00:08:18.079,4.239990234375, also during the Iron Age. So we're talking a span of hundreds of years between the supposed
99,00:08:18.079,00:08:23.160,5.08001708984375, events of Numbers 22 and the date of composition of both the Deir Allah inscription and Numbers
100,00:08:23.160,00:08:27.760,4.600006103515625, 22. It's more likely that both of these texts are drawing on a local tradition about
101,00:08:27.760,00:08:32.959,5.199981689453125, Balaam that was circulating east of the Jordan River in the 9th to 7th centuries BCE. The
102,00:08:32.959,00:08:37.040,4.08001708984375," story in Numbers also seems to reflect the political reality of the Iron Age, when the"
103,00:08:37.040,00:08:40.959,3.91998291015625, Kingdom of Moab was a frequent rival of the Israelite kingdoms.
104,00:08:40.959,00:08:46.800,5.84002685546875," So as Dr. Henry explained, it is possible that Balaam was in fact a real historical"
105,00:08:46.800,00:08:52.319,5.51995849609375," person. However, the extra-biblical source we have for him comes from the Iron Age, not"
106,00:08:52.319,00:08:57.600,5.280029296875," the Bronze Age. So in other words, it's not a contemporary source. Or it could be"
107,00:08:57.600,00:09:02.319,4.719970703125, that Balaam actually lived in the Iron Age and that the biblical authors simply placed
108,00:09:02.319,00:09:08.079,5.760009765625," him further back in time. Either way, we can't give Balaam the same kind of verification"
109,00:09:08.079,00:09:13.600,5.52001953125, that we can give to Shashank or Omri. Balaam's verification would be more at the level of
110,00:09:13.600,00:09:20.000,6.4000244140625," David. Regardless, the Deir Allah inscription is an amazing find and does at least open"
111,00:09:20.000,00:09:25.199,5.199951171875, the possibility that the Bible contains a reference to a real Bronze Age person who
112,00:09:25.199,00:09:29.680,4.48004150390625, was important enough in the region that his name was remembered centuries later.
113,00:09:29.680,00:09:35.360,5.67999267578125, Let's now take a look at the most important biblical figure from the Bronze Age – Moses.
114,00:09:35.360,00:09:40.399,5.03997802734375," Is there any evidence in the archaeological record of him? Well, there's one particular"
115,00:09:40.399,00:09:46.560,6.1600341796875, inscription that some argue does in fact mention Moses. I'm going to let PhD candidate Lachlan
116,00:09:46.560,00:09:50.959,4.39996337890625, Davis from the up-and-coming YouTube channel Tablets and Temples tell you more.
117,00:09:50.959,00:09:57.519,6.55999755859375," This is the Sinai 361 inscription, one of several carved inscriptions discovered near"
118,00:09:57.519,00:10:03.519,6.0, an ancient mining site on the Sinai Peninsula. Bold claims have been made that these texts
119,00:10:03.519,00:10:10.000,6.48004150390625," contain the name Moses as well as descriptions of events from the Exodus, such as Moses performing"
120,00:10:10.000,00:10:16.000,6.0, miracles and creating a bronze serpent statue. The inscriptions date to the 2nd millennium
121,00:10:16.000,00:10:23.280,7.27996826171875," BCE and are written in Proto-Sinaitic, the oldest known alphabetic script from which the Phoenician"
122,00:10:23.280,00:10:29.920,6.6400146484375, and Paleo-Hebrew alphabet is descended. So are these writings evidence for Moses and the Exodus?
123,00:10:29.920,00:10:35.519,5.5999755859375," One such advocate is Dr. Douglas Petrovich who translates the inscription as follows,"
124,00:10:35.519,00:10:41.680,6.1600341796875, Our bound servitude has lingered. Moses then provoked astonishment. It is a year of
125,00:10:41.680,00:10:48.160,6.47998046875, astonishment because of the lady. Such a reading evokes images of slavery and miracles performed
126,00:10:48.160,00:10:53.759,5.5999755859375," by Moses in the book of Exodus. Another translation by Professor Kramalkov reads,"
127,00:10:53.759,00:11:01.920,8.1600341796875," This is the site of where stood the snake of bronze that Mashae, meaning Moses, Mahub-Baalt made."
128,00:11:01.920,00:11:07.920,6.0, He argues this is a reference to the bronze serpent Moses created in the book of Numbers.
129,00:11:07.920,00:11:13.519,5.5999755859375," While these sensational claims are exciting, the reality is these translations have been"
130,00:11:13.519,00:11:20.240,6.72003173828125, heavily criticized and the texts likely don't say Moses at all. The Hebrew name Moses comes
131,00:11:20.240,00:11:26.639,6.39996337890625," from the Egyptian word Messi, meaning to give birth, and has S as its middle letter. However,"
132,00:11:26.639,00:11:31.840,5.20001220703125, translators who found Moses in the Sinai inscriptions have mistaken a letter for the
133,00:11:31.840,00:11:40.800,8.96002197265625," Phoenician s sound when it is actually a Sinaitic th letter, as in thin. So if the word is a name,"
134,00:11:40.800,00:11:47.759,6.9599609375," it's probably math, which means twin in Ugaritic. The scholar Dr. Aaron Wilson-Wright has demonstrated"
135,00:11:47.759,00:11:54.399,6.6400146484375, that these sensational Moses translations rely on restoring words that aren't in the inscription
136,00:11:54.399,00:11:59.840,5.44000244140625," and inventing new meanings for other words. So she proposes the following translation,"
137,00:11:59.840,00:12:06.800,6.96002197265625," O returner, those who tell people about math are beloved of the lady. The lady is the Egyptian"
138,00:12:06.800,00:12:14.720,7.91998291015625," goddess Hathor. This is a common expression among the Sinai inscriptions. Another text, Sinai 351"
139,00:12:14.720,00:12:20.959,6.239990234375," reads, Beloved of the lady are those who tell people about math, the miner and extractor."
140,00:12:20.959,00:12:28.079,7.1199951171875, And still another 349 calls math the chief of miners. It appears these inscriptions commemorate
141,00:12:28.079,00:12:35.040,6.96002197265625," a mining official, possibly named math, and offer blessings from Hathor. The texts make no reference"
142,00:12:35.040,00:12:41.280,6.239990234375," to Moses, snakes, or miracles, but they are a fascinating example of writing in the world's"
143,00:12:41.280,00:12:48.480,7.20001220703125," oldest alphabet and scholars are continuing to work on deciphering them. Okay, so maybe those"
144,00:12:48.480,00:12:54.720,6.239990234375," inscriptions don't refer to Moses, but there's lots of other evidence for the Exodus, right?"
145,00:12:54.720,00:13:01.120,6.4000244140625," Well, no. In recent years, several popular documentaries have come out which claim to go"
146,00:13:01.120,00:13:06.560,5.44000244140625," through lots of evidence for the Exodus, but in each case, the evidence presented is extremely"
147,00:13:06.560,00:13:13.120,6.55999755859375," flimsy and has not been verified by any actual experts. So for this topic, I'm going to let a"
148,00:13:13.120,00:13:18.959,5.8399658203125," real archaeologist, Raven De Silva from the channel Dig It with Raven, explain further."
149,00:13:18.959,00:13:23.199,4.239990234375," She has a new book coming out called The Other Ancient Civilizations,"
150,00:13:23.199,00:13:29.199,6.0," decoding archaeology's less celebrated cultures, which I'll leave a link to in the description."
151,00:13:29.199,00:13:30.560,1.36004638671875," Over to you, Raven."
152,00:13:30.560,00:13:35.920,5.3599853515625," Two stone pillars flank the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. Supposedly, they were erected by"
153,00:13:35.920,00:13:41.360,5.44000244140625, King Solomon to commemorate the crossing of the Red Sea by the Hebrews after they were freed by
154,00:13:41.360,00:13:48.639,7.27996826171875, Moses. But are these pillars actual archaeological evidence of this biblical event? Let's get into it.
155,00:13:48.639,00:13:55.519,6.8800048828125," In 1978, Ron Wyatt, an American nurse anesthetist and amateur archaeologist who claimed to have made"
156,00:13:55.519,00:14:02.879,7.3599853515625," over 100 biblical archaeological discoveries, found a red granite pillar at the Egyptian side"
157,00:14:02.879,00:14:09.600,6.72003173828125," of the Gulf at Nuweiba. According to his report, it was found on its side in the water itself,"
158,00:14:09.600,00:14:16.160,6.55999755859375, but today you can find it on the side of a road erected in concrete about 500 feet away from the
159,00:14:16.160,00:14:20.559,4.39996337890625, beach. Wyatt said that there was supposedly an inscription or there should have been an
160,00:14:20.559,00:14:26.879,6.32000732421875," inscription on this pillar that had since been eroded away, and he also said that it was of"
161,00:14:26.879,00:14:33.120,6.24005126953125," Hebrew or Phoenician origin and dated to around 3,000 years old. I tried to look at this pillar"
162,00:14:33.120,00:14:37.759,4.63995361328125," and date it off of the photos and biblical documentaries that are out there, but there"
163,00:14:37.759,00:14:45.199,7.44000244140625," aren't really many very detailed high quality images of this pillar, so it's really difficult"
164,00:14:45.199,00:14:50.160,4.96002197265625," to do so. I can't tell you how old it is with any confidence, but looking at the design of this"
165,00:14:50.160,00:14:58.160,8.0," pillar, I don't know about you, but it looks very non-descript to me. That means it could be from"
166,00:14:58.160,00:14:58.639,0.47998046875, anywhere
167,00:14:58.639,00:15:03.359,4.71999979019165," or any time throughout history, to be honest, unless we get a closer look at it"
168,00:15:03.359,00:15:08.199,4.840000629425049," and do some actual scientific research on it. The pillar doesn't have a capital, so"
169,00:15:08.199,00:15:12.559,4.359999656677246, that also doesn't really help in its identification. And when I think of
170,00:15:12.559,00:15:19.039,6.479999542236328," Phoenician pillar, I think of this. Ron Wyatt himself did not do any scientific"
171,00:15:19.039,00:15:22.559,3.520000457763672," studies on it, from what I've seen, because there are no peer-reviewed"
172,00:15:22.559,00:15:27.479,4.920000076293945," papers out there to actually talk about any of his discoveries. So again, there's"
173,00:15:27.479,00:15:33.079,5.599998474121094," nothing firmly documenting it anywhere saying that it was from 3,000 years ago"
174,00:15:33.079,00:15:38.439,5.3600006103515625," and it is of this design. In 1984, Wyatt claimed that he found a second pillar"
175,00:15:38.439,00:15:43.119,4.680000305175781, directly opposite Nuweiba on the opposite side of the Gulf in Saudi
176,00:15:43.119,00:15:48.759,5.6399993896484375," Arabia. It was apparently immediately removed by Saudi authorities, but it was"
177,00:15:48.759,00:15:51.839,3.0800018310546875, apparently inscribed with the following words on it.
178,00:15:51.839,00:16:00.319,8.479999542236328," Yahweh, Pharaoh, Mizraim, or Egypt, Moses, Death, Water, Solomon, and Edom. In what"
179,00:16:00.319,00:16:05.439,5.120002746582031, context? Wyatt didn't say. He also didn't mention any fragments of words or other
180,00:16:05.439,00:16:10.079,4.6399993896484375," words that maybe were, you know, connecting words or sentence words. And"
181,00:16:10.079,00:16:13.279,3.1999969482421875," he didn't mention, like, the placement of the words or what context. There's no"
182,00:16:13.279,00:16:17.119,3.8400039672851562, rubbing of the words or any photographic evidence of the words. So it all just
183,00:16:17.119,00:16:22.319,5.1999969482421875, seems very convenient and keyword-themed. It's almost like he was doing SEO for a
184,00:16:22.319,00:16:25.759,3.44000244140625, pillar. There's an extra layer of convenience as well because it was a
185,00:16:25.759,00:16:29.479,3.7199935913085938, mysterious pillar that was found and then it was swiftly taken away
186,00:16:29.479,00:16:35.679,6.200004577636719," immediately, only to have, like, a plaque in Saudi Arabia marking where it was. And"
187,00:16:35.679,00:16:39.599,3.9199981689453125," that's literally the only physical remains that we have, is this, like, little"
188,00:16:39.599,00:16:44.959,5.3600006103515625, commemorative plaque on the other side of the Red Sea. If Wyatt had taken any
189,00:16:44.959,00:16:50.319,5.3600006103515625," sort of photos of the pillar or, again, inscriptions, anything like that, then we"
190,00:16:50.319,00:16:54.919,4.599998474121094, could maybe talk about its legitimacy and a little bit more of the dating and
191,00:16:54.919,00:16:59.919,5.0," its connection to the one in Nuweiba. But until then, you know, it's one of those"
192,00:16:59.919,00:17:03.679,3.7600021362304688, things where the jury's out and you won't be able to convince me until I see
193,00:17:03.679,00:17:08.239,4.560005187988281, some hard scientific evidence. I also quickly want to point out that King
194,00:17:08.239,00:17:14.399,6.1599884033203125, Solomon supposedly erected these pillars 400 years after the Red Sea crossing
195,00:17:14.399,00:17:18.359,3.9600067138671875," apparently happened. Even if he did erect these pillars, that doesn't"
196,00:17:18.359,00:17:23.279,4.9199981689453125, actually mean that the crossing of the Red Sea happened. People erect religious
197,00:17:23.279,00:17:28.399,5.1199951171875," monuments all the time, and if it was so long after it happened, it doesn't"
198,00:17:28.399,00:17:33.479,5.0800018310546875, actually confirm that this event took place. What I do find interesting is that
199,00:17:33.479,00:17:38.479,5.0, Ron and his sons found and photographed supposed coral-encrusted chariot pieces
200,00:17:38.479,00:17:43.679,5.1999969482421875," at the bottom of the Red Sea, as well as chariot wheels and bones belonging to"
201,00:17:43.679,00:17:48.519,4.8400115966796875, both humans and horses. Apparently some of the wood that they found had gold
202,00:17:48.519,00:17:52.799,4.279998779296875," gilding on it, but it was too deteriorated and fragile to actually be"
203,00:17:52.799,00:17:57.799,5.0, removed from the water for any further scientific study. Images of these finds
204,00:17:57.799,00:18:02.639,4.839996337890625," were shown to Dr. Nassif Mohamed Hassan, the director of Egyptian antiquities at"
205,00:18:02.639,00:18:08.679,6.0399932861328125," the time, though whenever I google his name only biblical websites come up, so..."
206,00:18:08.679,00:18:13.239,4.5600128173828125," But Dr. Hassan claimed that one of the wheels was from the 18th dynasty,"
207,00:18:13.239,00:18:18.360,5.1200103759765625, apparently this is the only time that an eight-spoked wheel was used in ancient
208,00:18:18.360,00:18:23.239,4.8799896240234375," Egypt, which does include the reign of Rameses II. I'm not an expert in"
209,00:18:23.239,00:18:27.319,4.0800018310546875," Egyptian chariots, so I can't tell you, like, how many spokes were used for the"
210,00:18:27.319,00:18:30.880,3.5600128173828125," wheels throughout all of Egyptian history, but I can show you an image of"
211,00:18:30.880,00:18:35.880,5.0, Rameses II in a chariot when he was fighting the Hittites. Overall there's
212,00:18:35.880,00:18:42.520,6.6399993896484375, just a lot of speculation and looking at something that could fit and making a
213,00:18:42.520,00:18:46.640,4.1199951171875," claim without any sort of scientific evidence to back you up. Also, I'm sorry,"
214,00:18:46.640,00:18:50.840,4.1999969482421875, you can't look at this coral formation and immediately claim that it's an
215,00:18:50.840,00:18:55.660,4.82000732421875, entire ancient set of chariot wheels still attached to its axle. All of the
216,00:18:55.660,00:19:00.239,4.579986572265625, overlays on these bits of coral supposedly marking out all of the spokes
217,00:19:00.239,00:19:05.840,5.600006103515625," on a wheel are just wild to me. I'm not an underwater archaeologist, but this"
218,00:19:05.840,00:19:11.119,5.279998779296875, just looks... it just doesn't look right. Doesn't look right at all. Apparently a
219,00:19:11.119,00:19:15.320,4.20001220703125, human femur that Ron Wyatt found in the Red Sea was tested at Stockholm
220,00:19:15.320,00:19:21.380,6.05999755859375, University and it was determined that it came from a man about 165 to 170
221,00:19:21.380,00:19:25.720,4.339996337890625," centimeters tall, but from what I saw, there was no documentation stating"
222,00:19:25.720,00:19:30.720,5.0," actually how old it was. So again, it could have just been... it can just be a"
223,00:19:30.720,00:19:34.959,4.239990234375, bone. It might have just been a bone that was in the sea from someone else at any
224,00:19:34.959,00:19:40.679,5.720001220703125," other point in history. Contrary to some beliefs, archaeology is in fact a science"
225,00:19:40.679,00:19:46.839,6.15997314453125, and we don't make any conclusions unless there is irrefutable evidence that has
226,00:19:46.839,00:19:52.079,5.240020751953125, been checked multiple times by varying methods. So until there are proper
227,00:19:52.079,00:19:58.559,6.47998046875," archaeological tests, surveys, excavations, to me the Pillar of Solomon will remain"
228,00:19:58.559,00:20:03.999,5.44000244140625, simply a pillar in my eyes and all of the coral remains underneath the water
229,00:20:03.999,00:20:11.359,7.360015869140625," will simply be a rich, biodiverse home for sea life. So yeah, this all boils down"
230,00:20:11.359,00:20:17.319,5.959991455078125," to how archaeology actually works in the real world. You can't just say, oh I found"
231,00:20:17.319,00:20:22.559,5.239990234375, this thing but oops I didn't take photos and now it's gone. Or I think these
232,00:20:22.559,00:20:28.399,5.84002685546875," fuzzy photos kind of look like wheels, but no expert has ever seemed bothered"
233,00:20:28.399,00:20:33.119,4.720001220703125, to take a closer look at them. Even though the government of Egypt makes lots of

235,00:20:37.159,00:20:42.359,5.20001220703125," anything if they think it is legitimate. So the bottom line is, major discoveries"
236,00:20:42.359,00:20:48.279,5.91998291015625, are always reported in peer-reviewed journals so that other experts can chime
237,00:20:48.279,00:20:53.999,5.720001220703125, in and either debate things or verify things. They are not announced via
238,00:20:53.999,00:20:59.239,5.240020751953125, commercially made documentaries. This general principle can be applied to lots
239,00:20:59.239,00:21:04.199,4.959991455078125," more ridiculous claims that biblical literalists make, such as that this"
240,00:21:04.199,00:21:09.919,5.720001220703125, structure in Turkey is Noah's Ark or that this statue is Joseph because it
241,00:21:09.919,00:21:14.079,4.160003662109375, comes from around the right time and place and the figure appears to be
242,00:21:14.079,00:21:19.359,5.279998779296875, wearing a multi-colored coat. But just because something seems to fit the
243,00:21:19.359,00:21:24.039,4.67999267578125," biblical narrative, it doesn't automatically mean that it does. Okay, so"
244,00:21:24.039,00:21:27.839,3.79998779296875," when it comes to Moses and the Exodus story, there is currently no"
245,00:21:27.839,00:21:33.039,5.199981689453125, archaeological evidence that points to a person like the Bible describes or an
246,00:21:33.039,00:21:37.679,4.6400146484375, event like the Bible describes. Now that doesn't mean that there was definitely
247,00:21:37.679,00:21:43.479,5.79998779296875, no Moses-like person. Probably the story is based on something. But it's safe to
248,00:21:43.479,00:21:47.919,4.44000244140625, assume that the biblical version of Moses and the Exodus is more literature
249,00:21:47.919,00:21:53.879,5.959991455078125," than it is literal history. But what about the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and"
250,00:21:53.879,00:21:58.359,4.480010986328125," Jacob? When it comes to them, there's a claim out there that goes far beyond"
251,00:21:58.359,00:22:03.279,4.91998291015625," just finding their names etched into stones. In this case, some people believe"
252,00:22:03.279,00:22:08.959,5.680023193359375," that we actually know their precise burial place. Muslims, in particular,"
253,00:22:08.959,00:22:14.479,5.519989013671875," believe that at this site in Hebron, known as the Cave of the Patriarchs, lay"
254,00:22:14.479,00:22:19.799,5.32000732421875," not only the actual bones of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob but of Adam and Eve as"
255,00:22:19.799,00:22:25.479,5.67999267578125," well. I'll let the Useful Charts animator, Siawish Raymond, who also hosts the"
256,00:22:25.479,00:22:31.879,6.399993896484375," Islamic History Channel, Al-Muqaddimah, explain. In 638 CE, the Holy Land came"
257,00:22:31.879,00:22:36.919,5.040008544921875," under the control of the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam. The"
258,00:22:36.919,00:22:41.639,4.720001220703125," Rashidun Caliphate, under Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab, conquered cities like"
259,00:22:41.639,00:22:47.119,5.480010986328125," Jerusalem, Gaza, and Hebron which marked the transfer of the biblical holy sites,"
260,00:22:47.119,00:22:52.919,5.79998779296875," many of which are holy to Muslims, Jews, and Christians to Muslims. While the"
261,00:22:52.919,00:22:57.559,4.6400146484375, Caliphate didn't persecute religious minorities and even protected many of
262,00:22:57.559,00:23:02.519,4.959991455078125," their sacred sites, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, many other sites were"
263,00:23:02.519,00:23:08.279,5.759979248046875, converted to the Islamic tradition and made into mosques. Among these newly
264,00:23:08.279,00:23:13.239,4.96002197265625, Islamized mosques was the Ibrahimi Mosque which was previously a Byzantine
265,00:23:13.239,00:23:19.399,6.160003662109375, era basilica enclosed in a Herodian era complex. This complex was built shortly
266,00:23:19.399,00:23:25.039,5.6400146484375, before the birth of Jesus on top of a cave known as the Cave of the Patriarchs.
267,00:23:25.039,00:23:29.599,4.55999755859375," It's called that because according to the traditions of Judaism, Christianity,"
268,00:23:29.599,00:23:35.079,5.47998046875," and Islam, this is where the patriarchs and their wives are buried. It's said that"
269,00:23:35.079,00:23:39.839,4.760009765625," the patriarch Abraham, known as Ibrahim in Islam, bought this cave when his wife"
270,00:23:39.839,00:23:46.479,6.6400146484375," Sarah passed away. Then Abraham, his son Isaac, and Isaac's son Jacob were buried"
271,00:23:46.479,00:23:51.939,5.4599609375," along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah respectively. According to some"
272,00:23:51.939,00:23:57.519,5.58001708984375," sources, Adam and Eve are buried there as well. The complex that we see today was"
273,00:23:57.519,00:24:03.479,5.96002197265625," built by King Herod the Great of Judea shortly before Jesus was born. However,"
274,00:24:03.479,00:24:08.479,5.0," Josephus, who wrote so much about Herod's construction projects, doesn't give him"
275,00:24:08.479,00:24:13.919,5.44000244140625," credit for the complex. In 2020, a paper was published that mentioned pottery"
276,00:24:13.919,00:24:19.239,5.32000732421875, found at the site from multiple cities that dated as far back as the 8th
277,00:24:19.239,00:24:24.919,5.67999267578125, century BCE. This puts the site as a location that was visited by people
278,00:24:24.919,00:24:29.759,4.8399658203125, maybe from all over the Holy Land as far back as during the days of the Kingdom
279,00:24:29.759,00:24:35.599,5.84002685546875, of Judah. The Babylonian exile was still some two centuries in the future at this
280,00:24:35.599,00:24:41.039,5.44000244140625," point. What we know as Judaism today, which is in fact Rabbinic Judaism, didn't"
281,00:24:41.039,00:24:46.359,5.32000732421875," exist in its current form at all. However, while the 8th century BCE is"
282,00:24:46.359,00:24:52.099,5.739990234375," quite far back, it's still around 1,000 years after Abraham is supposed to have"
283,00:24:52.099,00:24:58.159,6.05999755859375," lived, which is around 1800 BCE or so. Now, according to the vast majority of"
284,00:24:58.159,00:25:03.639,5.47998046875," academic scholars, Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are purely mythological"
285,00:25:03.639,00:25:09.679,6.0400390625," characters and did not, in fact, exist. Since they didn't exist, their burial"
286,00:25:09.679,00:25:15.039,5.3599853515625," sites didn't exist either. However, this didn't stop people from claiming to have"
287,00:25:15.039,00:25:19.359,4.32000732421875," found bones down there. During the Islamic era, it was forbidden to go into"
288,00:25:19.359,00:25:24.639,5.27996826171875," the caves below the complex as a form of respect for the patriarchs. However, there"
289,00:25:24.639,00:25:29.879,5.239990234375," was a brief period of around a century, the 12th century to be precise, when the"
290,00:25:29.879,00:25:34.519,4.6400146484375," Holy Land was under Christian control, after the First Crusade. During this"
291,00:25:34.519,00:25:39.399,4.8800048828125," period, the caves were more accessible and a monk claimed to have found bones"
292,00:25:39.399,00:25:43.799,4.4000244140625, there. Although many sites around the world claim to be burial sites for
293,00:25:43.799,00:25:48.719,4.91998291015625," various biblical and Quranic figures, there are even multiple places claiming"
294,00:25:48.719,00:25:53.919,5.20001220703125," to be the burial place of the same person. So, the whole thing isn't very"
295,00:25:53.919,00:25:59.719,5.79998779296875," scientific. Okay, so it's safe to say that the traceable activity at the Cave of the"
296,00:25:59.719,00:26:04.559,4.8399658203125," Patriarch site goes no further back than the Iron Age, even though it"
297,00:26:04.559,00:26:09.439,4.8800048828125," supposedly contains the remains of people from the Bronze Age. So, unless"
298,00:26:09.439,00:26:14.559,5.1199951171875," someone opens the tombs and tests the supposed bones in there, this site"
299,00:26:14.559,00:26:19.119,4.56005859375, cannot be used as evidence for the existence of any biblical character. And
300,00:26:19.119,00:26:24.759,5.63995361328125," the same goes for the plethora of other sites, most of which are Islamic, which"
301,00:26:24.759,00:26:29.479,4.719970703125," claim to hold the bones of other biblical characters, such as Abel, Noah,"
302,00:26:29.479,00:26:35.399,5.91998291015625," and Moses. Okay, so I'm actually going to end this video on a positive note. That's"
303,00:26:35.399,00:26:39.679,4.280029296875," because there is one particular figure from the Bronze Age, for whom we have"
304,00:26:39.679,00:26:43.999,4.32000732421875," lots of contemporary evidence for, that might actually be mentioned by name in"
305,00:26:43.999,00:26:49.159,5.15997314453125," the Bible. So, this is not a central biblical character, but rather a foreign"
306,00:26:49.159,00:26:54.079,4.9200439453125," figure that is maybe mentioned in passing in the biblical text. In fact,"
307,00:26:54.079,00:26:59.079,5.0," it's a Bronze Age figure whose name is very well known, Hammurabi, King of"
308,00:26:59.079,00:27:04.879,5.79998779296875," Babylon. So, obviously, for this last segment, I had to ask a seriologist, Dr."
309,00:27:04.879,00:27:10.959,6.08001708984375," Joshua Bowen, from the channel Digital Hammurabi, for his thoughts. In Genesis"
310,00:27:10.959,00:27:18.199,7.239990234375," 14.1, we read, Now in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Ariak, king of Elisar,"
311,00:27:18.199,00:27:27.799,9.60003662109375," Kedor-la-Omer, king of Elam, and Tigal, king of Goyim. Who are these kings? Because"
312,00:27:27.799,00:27:31.719,3.91998291015625, Shinar is known to be another name for the land of Babylonia in the Hebrew
313,00:27:31.719,00:27:36.879,5.15997314453125," Bible, this led scholars to look for a Babylonian king, with whom to identify"
314,00:27:36.879,00:27:43.719,6.84002685546875," the first king, Amraphel. In the late 19th century, this king of Shinar was"
315,00:27:43.719,00:27:48.919,5.20001220703125," identified as Hammurabi, assuming that the Akkadian form of his name had been"
316,00:27:48.919,00:27:54.759,5.8399658203125," confused when brought into the Hebrew text. However, scholars later moved away"
317,00:27:54.759,00:27:59.759,5.0, from this view. A significant development came with the publication of three
318,00:27:59.759,00:28:04.799,5.0400390625, relatively late cuneiform texts that were likely copied from earlier texts
319,00:28:04.799,00:28:10.959,6.15997314453125," during the early 1st millennium BCE, known as the Spartoli tablets. These"
320,00:28:10.959,00:28:17.119,6.15997314453125, texts described four kings who fought against the city of Babylon. In the late
321,00:28:17.119,00:28:22.919,5.800048828125," 19th century, Pinchas, the scholar who published the tablets, read the name of"
322,00:28:22.919,00:28:30.719,7.79998779296875," one of the kings as Kedor-la-Hamal, or Kedor-la-Gamal, and made a connection"
323,00:28:30.719,00:28:37.759,7.03997802734375, between this name and the Kedor-la-Omer of Genesis 14. This led to scholars
324,00:28:37.759,00:28:41.879,4.1199951171875, looking at the names of the other kings in the Spartoli tablets to see if they
325,00:28:41.879,00:28:47.919,6.0400390625," could make other connections to those in Genesis 14. In the tablets, the king of"
326,00:28:47.919,00:28:54.199,6.27996826171875," Babylonia was named Ibil-Tutu, and it was argued that this name referred to the"
327,00:28:54.199,00:29:01.199,7.0, Babylonian usurper Marduk-apla-Idana. The name Marduk is written in Sumerian
328,00:29:01.199,00:29:07.599,6.4000244140625," Amar-Utu, and it was theorized that the writer of the biblical texts had at his"
329,00:29:07.599,00:29:14.119,6.51995849609375," disposal a shortened form of Marduk-apla-Idana's name, which consisted of the"
330,00:29:14.119,00:29:23.239,9.1199951171875," Amar of Amar-Utu, and Apal, thus Amar-Apal, which found its way into the Hebrew"
331,00:29:23.239,00:29:29.799,6.55999755859375," text as Amraphel. Recently, in a monograph about the history of the city"
332,00:29:29.799,00:29:35.039,5.24005126953125," of Babylon, Stephanie Dally presented the current opinions on this passage in an"
333,00:29:35.039,00:29:40.759,5.719970703125, appendix entitled Genesis 14 1 through 16 and possible links with foreign
334,00:29:40.759,00:29:47.159,6.4000244140625, rulers early in the reign of Hammurabi. There she notes that although scholars
335,00:29:47.159,00:29:51.639,4.47998046875, abandoned the early notion that Genesis 14 referred to kings from the time of
336,00:29:51.639,00:29:56.239,4.5999755859375," Hammurabi, this has again come back to be a tenable position."
337,00:29:56.239,00:30:05.199,8.960000038146973," the name Amraphel, she writes, either Hammurabi with an unexplained suffix l or Amudpl, king of"
338,00:30:05.199,00:30:12.399,7.199999809265137," Katna, with the common misreading of the letter r for d, possibly a confusion of the two names."
339,00:30:12.399,00:30:17.199,4.799999237060547," Although research in the last two decades, particularly from material from the time of"
340,00:30:17.199,00:30:23.919,6.719999313354492," Hammurabi at the city of Mari, has moved scholars back toward identifying the Genesis 14 names,"
341,00:30:23.919,00:30:29.919,6.000001907348633," including Amraphel, king of Shinar, with kings from the time of Hammurabi, it would appear that"
342,00:30:29.919,00:30:36.719,6.799999237060547," we still do not possess enough information to draw definitive conclusions. Okay, so that's a"
343,00:30:36.719,00:30:44.319,7.599998474121094, maybe and a very interesting one at that. If the Amraphel mentioned in Genesis 14 is in fact a
344,00:30:44.319,00:30:51.119,6.799999237060547," reference to the great king Hammurabi of Babylon, then that means that Hammurabi is the oldest known"
345,00:30:51.119,00:30:58.079,6.960002899169922, historical figure mentioned by name in the Bible. And it also means that we have verification for at
346,00:30:58.079,00:31:04.959,6.880001068115234," least one Bronze Age person. Now, it actually makes sense that Hammurabi's name in particular"
347,00:31:04.959,00:31:11.599,6.6399993896484375," might have found its way into the Bible. According to critical scholars, Genesis 14 was most likely"
348,00:31:11.599,00:31:19.199,7.599998474121094," written during the Babylonian captivity, which took place following 586 BCE. Being that Hammurabi"
349,00:31:19.199,00:31:24.479,5.279998779296875," was one of the most famous Babylonian kings of all time, it's not hard to believe that the"
350,00:31:24.479,00:31:29.519,5.040000915527344, Judahite scribes living in Babylon during the 500s might have heard about him and might have
351,00:31:29.519,00:31:35.599,6.0800018310546875," decided to work him into their nation's origin story. So, the conclusion is still that there is"
