

Hi, everyone. This is Jennifer Bagnasi with Deep Believer. Our guest today saw heaven twice, once when she was young, the other when she was older. When she was older, she was actually escorted to the artillery room in heaven. Not only that, but she accidentally got wrapped up into witchcraft, and when she did, she was actually taken into different realms through portals and tormented. But not only that, she mentioned something that is happening right now. A lot of people are being taken into false paradises. People are having NDE experiences that actually are not from God, but they think they're in heaven. So she's here to explain why that is so, and she gives us detail.
        Copy



Sandy Lin Taylor, thank you so much for being with us today.
        Copy



Thank you so much, Jennifer. It is an honor to be here.
        Copy



And it is an honor to have you. So Sandy Lin, you were actually raised in the Philippines, and you didn't have that well of a childhood. So tell us about your childhood.
        Copy



So I will start when I was young. I was one and a half year old when my parents abandoned me because of poverty, and my dad is into drugs. And so they got separated when my mom was about to go to Saudi Arabia. I was one and a half year old, and she just told me that she's going to buy candy in the store. But she didn't come back for years. And that's the story that she told me. She honestly told me that she lied when she needed to go, but it's really painful on her side too.
        Copy



I was raised as a pagan, Jennifer. So there's no person who's telling me who is Jesus about the Bible, about God. So in the Philippines, Jennifer, we are majority Catholic, but I was raised as a pagan. And being raised as a pagan, I grew up full of fears and anxiety. This time of my life is really hard for me. This is very, very hard, abandonment issues and all sorts of abuse. So I'm not going to put in detail so much about it, but the abuse started when I was really young. It's somehow close to me, that person. And from there, everything started to get dark in my life and with the way I walked until I grew up.
        Copy



So at that time where I was a pagan and growing up with not having so many things, God already showed me this vision when I was five years old. So this open vision is, I will never forget this. Even until now, it's just amazing. So everyone was sleeping at this time, Jennifer, and we were in a very small apartment in Manila. And there's this window there in our room. As soon as I woke up that early morning, I heard this music. It's really the one that captivates me. It's the one that really drew me to go and look up at the sky.
        Copy



On that vision, the music keeps on playing. Just seeing what I'm seeing at that time, it's the first time I experienced that joy, that love. When I saw the man on the road, the image of him there in the sky, what really I couldn't forget were his eyes. Even though he didn't speak to me, he's telling me of his love. He's telling me that he's the embodiment of all the goodness and love of joy, that peace that transcends human understanding. It's the first time I experienced that. I thought it's an imagination or something because I'm confused when I was young. But it's very vivid; I could not forget that.
        Copy



And then there's another instance. It also happened in the same place, in the apartment, but I was outside at this time, Jennifer. And then suddenly I was, you know, maybe anticipating or expecting I would see another vision because I'm really after that amazing feeling. And so I looked up again at that time and I saw this open heaven. It's like the cloud had bursting colors; it's like gold, but then beyond that, there were so many bursting colors. It's so beautiful.
        Copy



And there's this river. And now that I'm a Christian, I read that in Revelation where I think it is the river of living water. I cannot describe in my human understanding how the place is; it's simply beautiful but alive, something miraculous and majestic about that place.
        Copy



After those experiences, I was actually jumping for joy and my relatives thought like, oh, she's a child just playing around. But I was like, there's someone in there, living in that place like that.
        Copy



At a very young age, I already lost my innocence. And these visions I was seeing just turned everything in my life dark.
        Copy



I went to different places with different people who would take care of us—relatives and other neighbors and people. I want to emphasize this, Jennifer: this is a very important role of parents that God entrusted us with. The mother should be the sole protector of their children. The mother should be the one who prays fervently for their children.
        Copy



When children don't have their parents to guide them and protect them, they are open to all kinds of attacks because that's what I experienced. I've been sexually abused and molested by different people. At first, Jennifer, I always felt that it was always my fault. Every time things happened, I felt like it was my fault because maybe I'm too weak to resist or couldn't do something about it.
        Copy



I couldn't even speak up about it; I just felt so guilty inside all my life. That confidence and innocence in me were gone.
        Copy



There comes a point in my life where fear turned into pain at a young age; I already felt that pain.
        Copy



At that time, I'm not only sexually abused but also verbally abused; everyone would curse you in a way that's harmful because sometimes we're not too careful with words.
        Copy



People said so many things like "this person is just going to be a nobody." I was really persecuted a lot when I was young.
        Copy



After verbal abuse came physical abuse; the worst of all abuses is spiritual abuse.
        Copy



I witnessed many things a young child shouldn't see—like pornography—and I was surrounded by everything going on in that environment where love and grace were unheard of.
        Copy



This is how God kept me at that time; He showed me mercy even during those young years.
        Copy



Even though my environment was harsh, God never removed my adventurous spirit.
        Copy



I watched Huckleberry Finn and felt related because he was homeless yet free to adventure.
        Copy



In elementary school, we learned about Four Faces of the Mountain from our teacher's book; touching it made me say someday I'd visit there.
        Copy



God instilled great hope within me despite struggles—it kept dreams alive despite adversary strongholds influencing areas through provincial genre mediums or witchdoctors practicing pagan rituals involving animal sacrifices witnessed without comprehension then but undeniably contributing towards opening evil portals later apparent throughout perilous experiences encountered especially upon dark smoky shadow sightings featuring horrifyingly hot menacing eyes indicating realms beneath incredulity overwhelming senses tantamounting paralyzing fear leading unresolved apparent recurring escalatory patterned observations realized nearer eventuating extremities amid malign abuses surreptitionsly accompanying progressively worsening tormentations rapidly accumulating thereafter grievously endured impairingly under duress rendered unimaginable manageable encompassing relationally emphasized firmly parents pivotal protective vigilant prayer-driven impactful influence affirmably highlighted indispensably motherily directive spiritually undeniably asserting enormous defensive standpoints vitally encircling impassionately curvaturealized familial bulwarks absolutely prioritized frontiers widely encompassing extraordinary requisite proactively dynamically worshiped persistently safeguarding ultimately unswervingly perseverantly foundationally unwavering shelters uncompromisingly intercediality core stabilizing transformative wholesomely empowered essentially predicating peri-lifelong pivotal suitably above-undermentioned defined keystone imperative contours cherishing sanctified divine mission unfoldingly perpetually acknowledged supremely chiefly cherished amidst crucial thereby preeminent irrefutably supreme imperative consequently holistically-committedly integrally frontlined resolvedly emphasizing exceedingly utmost paramount priorities perennially therein absolutely commended irremissibly herein unquestionably irrevocable conclusory prominent thematic central impactful meanwhile perpetually underscored embodying notably privileged integral committed linkage entwining centrally missionary intrinsicality holistically inscribed endearingly familial emphasizing vigilantly imperatively pivotal safeguarding supreme prioritized demonstrated pertinently herein fundamentally highlighted eternally undisputed potently safely renowned maximized safeguarding perennihigh-pivotal.)


I always feel that pain. I feel like, you know, when was the time I'm going to ride in there and I'll be with my mom, looking up, you know, always looking up, hoping, you know, that I get to really have a real parents. Just growing up, seeing other kids of mine having a normal family. My life is really not a normal one. So, yeah. I know you said your mom left, but what happened to your father? I don't think you mentioned your father.
        Copy



Yeah. So after they separated, like what I said, my mom worked in Saudi Arabia. My dad, he went to Manila, to Makati. But it's like, I had no news about him. I had no idea what he looks like because everyone says he's a bad man. He's a drug addict all his life. So that's how they describe it to me. Yeah. So, yeah. So I stay away from him.
        Copy



So who did they leave you with? With relatives, so many relatives. Sometimes neighbors. So it really depends on where we're going to school or if the person still can handle us, you know?
        Copy



Did your mother ever tell you why she left? Yeah. She said when the point where my dad physically abused her, he really hurt her because I think because of my dad's doing this marijuana, he was always in the spirit of jealousy and anger and suspicion. You can't even talk to any man because if my dad found out, there's that physical abuse. And also poverty is another reason because since my dad not providing anything, she needs to step and find a good life for us. Those are what my mom keeps on always telling us, the reason why she needs to leave us. But of course it doesn't really make sense to me. All I just understand is the fear of just seeing her always leaving us.
        Copy



And I know you said that you were in the occult. Is that because you saw people in the occult around you? Yes, because they were our neighbors, Jennifer. When I was young, I think it was around the nineties. Christianity was not so popular in our town, it was in the province in Philippines. We deeply believed more in the elders who would tell us stories about aswang and witches and those paganism practices. We were raised in a discipline where the parents would say, "If you're not going to behave, I'm going to give you to aswang." That's how we were motivated by fear to behave. Growing up like that was crazy.
        Copy



We were exposed to mediums coming to our house and telling us our future. A witch woman medium once told me that I would never leave my town and would be married to a lowly nobody and live a life of nothingness. She didn't only say this to me but also to other kids. However, I felt strongly that this wasn't my life. I had dreams and believed in their possibility and didn't embrace the bleak future foretold by the medium.
        Copy



Jennifer, one of the most special moments in my life happened when I was 12 years old. There was a person in our province who held a Bible and shared the gospel with us. It was very odd to me, this kind of belief, the first time I'd encountered it. Of all the things he said about worship and Jesus enthroning you, one thing struck me the most: he said that God can be your father. At that time, I believe God used that word because the desperation of me having a father drew me to Him.
        Copy



I was so hungry to have that father figure and prayed fervently as a twelve-year-old girl: "God, if you're real like what this man says, and you can be my father, can you be my father?" That prayer stayed with me until this day; God remembered that prayer of that twelve-year-old girl. As soon as I started to pray and learn how to pray to Him, my journey of having Him as my dad began and everything started to become beautiful.
        Copy



But there was a problem: I accepted Him as my savior but not as my Lord because I wasn’t deeply rooted in the word. It's very important for Christians to be deeply rooted in God's word. My relatives initially allowed me to attend Bible study because they thought it wouldn't harm our beliefs and saw it as a passing phase.
        Copy



At home, they mocked me for bringing a Bible and praying but noticed that the feisty and rebellious child was changing. The one who used to street fight was now smiling and filled with joy. They sensed that the Bible study was affecting me.
        Copy



One Sunday while ironing my clothes for church, they confronted me about going there. They thought Christianity involved brainwashing and didn't want me influenced by it. Despite their protests and beatings from trying to stop me, I secretly sneaked out to attend church because I longed for experiencing this father figure promised.
        Copy



When they found out about my sneaky actions, I was locked up and forbidden from going to church. Desperate, I sought help from church elders who politely asked my uncle if they could let me attend services. My uncle refused and insisted on raising me their way until adulthood.
        Copy



Feeling let down by God for not allowing me church access despite promises of being a father figure, I felt abandoned once again but decided to give faith another chance when I turned 18.
        Copy



However, by then, bitterness took over; abuse continued more severely during my teenage years leading me towards intense rebellion and hatred for men due to the military-style upbringing surrounded by male cousins.
        Copy



By age 17, two key events occurred: meeting a seemingly charming friend involved in a Wiccan group due to college curiosity with activities like "Spirit of the Glass," akin to Ouija boards which young people found cool.
        Copy





Um, she really looked innocent but she gave me this paper. It's just an ordinary paper, Jennifer. And then she told me, "Hey, you want something cool? You read this tonight." I was like, "Okay." And it's like, you know, we're hungry for, you know, something—power or something magic, you know, so cool, something like that. So that night I read that chant. It is a chant the way it's written. It's a chant. And now, um, going back, I just opened my Bible and I see the name of that thing that I summoned. I didn't realize. And Jennifer, this is no ordinary demon. It's something—it's in the Bible actually; Paul mentioned that. Yeah, I don't want to say her name.
        Copy



So when you say you mentioned this chant, this is how you accidentally fell into witchcraft because your friend gave you this paper to, I guess, speak aloud and you did it? Yeah, he came out. No, that's another thing about these entities. When they come and visit you, they're always sending someone, you know? Like, different this night, different this night. So I don't know—based on my experience of all these spirits I saw, I think I got to see her. But I'm really definitely 100% sure when I started that and I summoned the name, nothing happened. You know? It's like I just read it like a normal thing; nothing happened. Okay. You know? I was actually waiting, anticipating when nothing happened.
        Copy



And then after that night and the next following night—I was college at this time—this is something beyond me, Jennifer. I didn't realize I opened a portal because, like what I said, I grew up as a pagan and sometimes they made us drink this Latin paper. They roll it and they make us drink it. You know? So many paganism practices. So I'm not really unfamiliar with this—I'm so used to those. So that's why for me just reading this is like something... I don't know how that—this is a big deal though.
        Copy



So at the time, as soon as that portal opened they just come sometimes by group, sometimes one. And you really sense the evil presence. It's like if I will describe this evil presence—they have different levels of evil presence although they are evil. The level of their evil presence is different: some are really way thicker, way bigger—you know that the level of their evilness or their powers—you just kind of sense it. That's how I can describe it.
        Copy



I actually really started to not go to college at that time because I feel like my mind is going insane. Like I feel like I'm going to lose it and my mental stability is not good anymore. I'm not on drugs, Jennifer. Even though I'm exposed to alcohol, drugs or being the cool kid, I'm not into drugs. That's why it's very clear to me what I see is what I saw because I'm clean—I'm not into drugs at the time when that happens.
        Copy



Every night I have a nightmare. At this time I'm not aware about astral projection; it's not being—I'm not educated about astral projection but I didn't realize I'm doing an astral projection at that time. It's like I was way too advanced. Sometimes in my house, in our house—I was just sitting and somewhere my body is going to be lifted and it's just like a blink and I was in this place—that's how fast and how crazy it is.
        Copy



There's this instance that I was in college at this time and I'm the very first in that room in my classroom. So I'm waiting for my teacher and for my classmates. So while waiting, I just sit on my teacher's desk and I didn't realize I fell asleep. They said to me for 45 minutes I'm unconscious—no matter what they did they couldn't wake me up. They said, "What's going on with you?" And then my classmates made jokes like, "Do that next time so we'll have no class interruption," something like that.
        Copy



But they never realized that at the time they were all laughing and thinking I'm just tired—they don't know how serious it was for me at that time. I couldn't stop it. And you know the difference about being visited by those demons is you just feel somewhere inside you that's been trespassed and you couldn't even shake off that filthy feeling—like you're being spiritually abused or it's just dirty—that's how I felt.
        Copy



That time when my classmates were trying to wake me up, I was actually in a different place—this realm that I saw. The first realm that I saw—I couldn't forget this place—it looks like there's no sky. Can you imagine that? There is no sky but it looks like somehow like a glass on top but it's not the glass that we have here on earth; it's like something watery-looking material.
        Copy



There's this dead tree—and you know what? In the Bible in Genesis—I don't know why God really has something to do with the tree—because in the time of Adam and Eve there's the tree of good and evil and there's the tree of knowledge—and even in heaven there is the tree of life. In this realm it's very striking to me—I saw this tree as this huge dead tree in that place. It's very cracked and dry and every time I try to run it's like you're trapped in that realm—every time you try to run you go back to the beginning.
        Copy



It's so paranoid—you keep on running trying to find an escape and you always go back to the exact place where you are—the dry cracked place and the tree—and the tree is always there wherever I run it's always there. There's just that enchanting giant dead tree—I couldn't forget that.
        Copy



The second experience also happened when I was in college—in my room doing a siesta. Um siesta—I'm not sure if you're familiar with that—it’s an afternoon nap? Was it? Yes, yes—we call it siesta—it's a Spanish term for an afternoon nap—in tropical countries we do afternoon naps.
        Copy



I do the afternoon nap and in my belief this place I saw was hell—this is how I see it as I describe it. So I thought I was still in our house—I thought so—I opened the door of our house outside and it's a different world—I’m like what where is this? I was really confused.
        Copy



Suddenly in the sky—I saw what looked like a bird—that's what I thought—but in the realm Jennifer you have this vision—even though it's far you can see it clearly—I don't know how to describe it—but your vision is so intense—even though it's far when you look at it and you're drawn to it gives you the detail.
        Copy



I saw—I am surrounded—the sky was surrounded by what looked like giant birds—but they look evil—they have sharp claws like—a human-bird hybrid—that's how I can depict it—but they are evil—you can feel their presence—and they're hovering all over the sky—it’s so dark—the place is gloomy—misery—you sense all kinds of sadness loneliness that you can ever imagine not found on earth—the atmosphere is heavy.
        Copy



When I looked at the place where I was in my house—in a blink of an eye—I was at the center of the ground of that place—that’s how crazy it is—in the spiritual realm if you're not permitted to go there it's dangerous—like an illegal alien crossing borders—that's the danger if you're unauthorized—even more dangerous if you're in a different realm.
        Copy



The grace of God kept me from danger—I saw lots of souls—lots of people—but they didn't seem alive—they were wearing ragged dirty clothes—it felt like they were already dead—you have an inner knowing there—they seemed dead but shackled—all of them were shackled—and there was this huge dark angel—it wasn’t heavenly—it looked like a guardian of that place—a shadow with a hood—it looked like a shepherd because the souls are his flock leading them to their doom.
        Copy



I screamed at them to stop—to wake up—they were falling one by one into a big dark cave—a mouth of darkness—they were in a trance unaware of their doom—I was trying to help but felt like held behind an imaginary glass—it made me feel helpless as they fell one by one despite my efforts to stop them.
        Copy



I managed to return home by screaming Jesus or something similar—not clear—but by God's grace, I returned to my body—first thing was drinking water—so thirsty—whole nerves exhausted—felt tired like running a marathon for days—that's how tiring it was.
        Copy



What do you think that tree was? According to my friend who is Wiccan—it has something to do with rituals when they're summoned—in our realm before traveling somewhere we use an airport—the tree works similarly—a door or portal transferring between realms—a door before another portal.
        Copy




```html


You know, really passionate for Jesus Christ. She said that she always saw that tree also, like a different level of that and that's why she said it's like a portal going to a different place, a different realm. It's like a place where you're kind of like a nothingness. It's like a nothingness generally. It's like a place like an airport where you land first before you go to some certain, you know, they are also organized in Rome. They're more organized than us, you know, because, you know, it's just how things work. It's just beyond me.
        Copy



That's how I can say that time. And I was just a, I just, everyone thought I'm a normal college student. Were you astral projecting and having any of these creepy visions before you did this, that chant that your friend gave to you? Yeah, that's where it started. So before then you didn't have those, you just had the experience of you when you were five seeing heaven. Yeah. It's just like some random event that I will just get to see and experience.
        Copy



But I think it became so, so deep in me because Jennifer, I wanted also to, for everyone to know this, the generational bloodline of what I have, the generational curse is real. It's in the Bible. It's happened from first generation to fourth generation that it's never been caught and never been freed by the blood of Jesus Christ. And having not come to the relationship of Jesus Christ, this will go on.
        Copy



And like what I said, I grew up as a pagan. So, you know, so it means that as soon as I opened the chant, I already have that deep level of ancestral connection about all these things. That's how I can think why this became so deep when I opened that portal because of the ancestral rights and the legal rights of the enemy, you know, from the generation before my forefathers to us. Yeah. Our generation. Yeah.
        Copy



And I'm glad you mentioned that because a lot of people don't understand that generational curses are real and that the reason why we do experience some things that we do is because of the generational curses that say our parents or our grandparents or great grandparents or a great, great. So could you just explain a little bit about generational curses? So our audience is aware that this is real.
        Copy



So the generational curses it's been mentioned in the Bible, it's actually in the Old Testament, right? That the first generation to the fourth generation, if, you know, you've been practicing, worshipping, you know, the idolatry, different gods. So the curses or the wrath, it will be from first to fourth generation. And it's a make or break. That's why, okay, I'm going to explain this in the Bible from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob.
        Copy



You see, there is a, it's not really a deep, because they worship God, they are really faithful to that. But the sin, okay, let's just say it's that sin. Okay. So from Abraham, you know, that sin passes through Isaac into Jacob, you know, like Abraham lied, Isaac lied. And then Jacob became worse, you know, you see how it got deeper. So he betrayed.
        Copy



And the fourth generation, which is Joseph, like isn't really in a bad, bad place, because for him, you know, for that to happen, you know, yeah, so that's why, you know, it's been, you know, in slavery and abandonment, like so much things happened to him, but he never did anything. But, you know, God break the curse, and that generational curse, through the time of Joseph when you know.
        Copy



Yeah, there are five tests Jennifer. There are five tests in the life of a child of God: the test of time, the test of faith, the test of purity, the test of forgiveness and the test of love. And with what happened to Joseph is the test of purity and he passed that. You know it's amazing! So that's just it's not really a curse we're talking about here. It is just a sin.
        Copy



I mean not just sorry because sin is a really big thing I mean it's serious. I don't want them to take it lightly so yeah I don't want it to be misunderstood but what I mean is they didn't do idolatry but they sin and that's what happened it passes. And if it was being cut off from the first to the next following generation it will be a blessing. You know like it's a blessing.
        Copy



You know that's also what the Bible mentioned remember? Yeah so that's why you know in the Davidic timeline in Solomonic timeline with David there's lots of fights he go into a lot of fights you know and then by the time he didn't pass to Solomon it's like a time of peace in the kingdom because the word is obedience I think that is the best word is that obedience and you know our full devotion to the one true God which is Jesus Christ.
        Copy



And with my ancestral like what I said the Christian generation that we have I mean a lot of stuff I mean in our town there's this you can search it also on YouTube like someone's dancing on the fire I mean you know like those are you know like they summon demons to do that and when I was young I couldn't forget this one where I saw this woman he counted something and immediately that possessed lady the spirit transferred to the animal and of course they need to kill the animal immediately.
        Copy



So as soon as they kill the animal immediately something come out from it I was just like what is that I just saw it! I was just so scary I was so scared at that time like oh wow this is real so by the time I was young I already know that they're existing and the evil exists even though they want to make us look that they're just a figure of imagination but not where I grew up.
        Copy



That's why when I believe in God I know that he's real because if the darkness is real light is much much real. So tell us about the time when the portal was opened and you were taken into a portal. I was really actually looking for my friend like I wanted to understand what's going on what did you give me but guess what she transferred from a different university. I was like she's not there.
        Copy



You know I'm like oh wow like she just fulfilled whatever she needs to fulfill you know and so there's this one there's this story but this doesn't happen when I was in college somehow I was graduated already you know like I was actually like started to know God and I think the enemy is trying to prevent me to really give my loyalty to God's kingdom.
        Copy



So I always see some door something like that This is a door Jennifer and then it looks like a very ancient door it's like an ancient door with its hard to it's like it's been there for so long it's like its exist it's like ancient ancient I think that's the best way I can describe it.
        Copy



And so I was taken into this place where it is it is in my human perception for our listener to kind of really imagine this it looks like a warehouse but it's a realm okay when it's like a warehouse it looks like that and then this woman this little girl she's little girl.
        Copy



Like what I said before I often see them visiting or I often see them talking like that or showing things in the realm but this one is different because the evil presence of that girl she's not a girl she's not an ordinary girl she is full of you know like she learned so many cunning ways that's how I can describe it she's full of craftiness.
        Copy



I don't say wisdom crafty like she's just pure evil like there's nothing good in her because when I look at her she looked like she dressed up like an ancient little girl like she came from a past from the past past past like that kind of clothes is way back from the past.
        Copy



And then she she's laughing and I don't want to hear her laugh yeah yeah yeah at that time I was really you know just hearing her laugh is just it's like dragging you to hell that's how I can describe that kind of laugh it's like that and so she just don't speak to me but she just grabbed me and just we go to this place.
        Copy



And as we were you know it's like this it's like this how can I so I was sitting at that time I was sitting before we go to that part I was sitting and then suddenly I just saw her in front of me and she just run run forward she just run there she just trying to show me something so I just looking at her.
        Copy



I was just looking at her and then I now realized she dragged me and I was next to her I was like whoa! Like I was just seeing her running there and now you know I was next to her it's so scary at first so scared by the blood of Jesus Lord by the blood of Jesus Christ Lord I'm not saying this to entertain fear or promote fear in the hearts of listeners.
        Copy



I was trying to by the grace of God to just expose you know the experience that has been kept in me for so long and you know I always feel discouraged to always speak about this because of the fear of retaliation but this is the word that God gave me 1 John 4:4 for greater is He that's living in me than he that's in the world.
        Copy



And also Isaiah 54:17 no weapon forms against me shall prosper. I just need to say that Jennifer because the atmosphere I just sensed is something. So as we'll continue by the blood of lamb in name of Jesus Christ so while we're next to her she said look she said look she's such right playful playful evil child that's all can describe her.
        Copy



And Jennifer she's not child cause she can shapeshift herself I'll just tell later so now she's child that's what looks like then she told look look like that so look and saw man she's doing regular day eating his meal eating his meal then she's laughing hey we put something his food you don't know it playful evil thing. Then said look what's going put his mouth normal regular day looks he's just eating normal burger normal meat but said watch soon guy put mouth became raw rotten hard describe nasty very nasty.
        Copy



It's best describe meat that's been stuck six months doesn't look meat anymore looks dark gross nasty putting mouth soon man eating normal food laughed laughed laugh laughed echoed room warehouse all four corners warehouse couldn't want hear anymore cause he's laughing evil said man realize moment people food about kill gonna die said playful child play He's gonna die couldn't even talk scary girl couldn't even look evil presence strong couldn't look feels look gonna die that's evil gravity evil presence man keeps eating want stop doing don't eat couldn't feel do something harm bad dumbfounded suddenly ran ran ran where going ran place mocking maybe knows somehow child accepted Jesus somehow child God trying put illusion paradise heard lot near death experience listened near death experience YouTube.

```
```html


Because somehow, when you have this kind of experience, I'm still on the point where I'm still studying, Jennifer. I'm still learning and doing a lot of research about what I experienced. So I'm listening and trying to ask the Holy Spirit and ask God if this near-death experience is from Him. There are many ridiculous near-death experiences that I'm hearing a lot. That, okay, okay, go on, that kind of experience is not a real heaven, it is an illusion. And I think that kind of entity, because she has that full power, she can manifest a place where it is a very illusion place.
        Copy



Because as soon as she ran, she brought me in this place that looked like a paradise. She wanted me to believe that I am in heaven. So we got out of that warehouse and there's that paradise. Jennifer, it's so beautiful. There's flowers, the grass is so green, like very green. And there's also little children like her, they're playing and they're having fun of their life. And then she said, go on. She said to me, go, go there, walk. But something is odd about this place. Something is odd.
        Copy



Heaven can only be heaven if the presence of God is there. And that's where you know that it is heaven. But for someone who never encountered God, who never had a relationship with Jesus Christ, and you never know the word of God, never have prayer in your life, you have no idea that deception is so high that you will have no idea that it is not heaven, but it is an illusion paradise.
        Copy



That's what, you know, because me, I think when she's trying to tell me to go on, she wanted me to trap in this place. She wanted me to trap in there. And if I embrace the thing that, okay, I am in heaven, I'm doomed. She was going to trap me in there because I put my faith in the belief that that place is a paradise. But because this is how I kind of really try to really analyze this, how this evil girl will give me a paradise? I mean, how will she able to bring me there? She is no angel, you know?
        Copy



And even though I have a little knowledge about the Bible when I was young, God sealed me. When I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, I think that's what really kept me from discerning that it is a false paradise. There's also light in that place, Jennifer. This is like a paradise where there is light, but the light there is different. It's not compared to the light of God. It's different.
        Copy



I don't know how she produced light, but if I see it, it's so dim. It's not like light, like it's just dim. I don't know where she come up with that, but the place looks like afternoon. Afternoon in the paradise is what it looks like. It looks so gloomy. And the more I look at the place, suddenly, while she keeps on convincing me to go in there, a place where they sit like a bench.
        Copy



It looks like a bench or something like that. It looks like a beautiful park, paradise field, flowers, everything. But it's an illusion because as soon as you look at it intently, Jennifer, the longer you look at it, you see some odd in that place. There is a shade of darkness. I'm like, if this is real paradise, there should not be any like this.
        Copy



Yeah, so I run. As soon as I had the chance, I ran. I ran. I ran and I ran. And I'm like, God help me. I'm trying to say it in my mind. I couldn't escape. I'm trying to run. And then I go back to the warehouse again. And then when I ran, I go back to that paradise again. But I really don't go inside. That's the thing.
        Copy



Because I know if I go in, she will trap me. I think that's what she's after. And so she said to me, OK, you call your God because that's where I don't know. I think she heard my thought because I said, Jesus Christ, help me. I'm just screaming. God, God, let me out.
        Copy



But while I'm screaming, my mouth is not moving. It's like my thought is screaming. It's like, let me out, Jesus Christ, let me out. That's why I keep on saying I'm like screaming and wailing inside my thoughts.
        Copy



And then she got mad at me and she said, OK, OK, that's not nice, she said to me. That's not nice. Why are you calling your God? I don't want to... She's like a child. I don't want this game anymore. I don't want this game.
        Copy



That's not cool like that. Why are you calling your God like that? And then suddenly there's a hole that's been opened to me. It's like in that room; there's like a hole that's been opened. It's like there's that light.
        Copy



It's like a very like the light getting that hole so I burst in light and then suddenly it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. The light gets bigger and I was stuck in that light and I was hearing her and she said to me, I'm not done with you.
        Copy



I'm going to find you. I'm going to kill you like that. Like the very bones of this little evil girl. She hates me to the core; that's how I can describe how she hates me so much.
        Copy



And then she's like you're getting away like that so she's she's just like a child that lose a toy; it's just having tantrums like that.
        Copy



When you have this kind of experience in the room Jennifer sometimes you feel like you're in a trance or sometimes you're in a normal situation environment; you're in the classroom or you're in the house but you couldn't function because the memory of the trauma that's inflicted in you is so deep.
        Copy



Sometimes I even lose myself to eat or even I don't know the past; the time just passed and I'm just not being productive; I just feel so depressed.
        Copy



Depression is another spirit that's operating in the world and if you notice it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and so it's not something because you're sad or something but sometimes it's influence of them.
        Copy



I was so depressed and sometimes they said to me this one she's a familiar spirit; she looks like my sister so she come to me very nice and very polite.
        Copy



She said to me you can come here now; it is safe here because the world where you live in is the same as the world where we are; it's just an illusion; everything is an illusion.
        Copy



It doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter ok just come here you know so you have no problem; you know you have no struggle; you just live with us in peace.
    
    
        
They don't use the word peace but it’s more like you can live with us because this is real.
        Copy



I think that's what they're using it like; this is more real and somehow that's why I'm telling you I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.
    
    
        
Once you experience seeing another realm another world when you come back to Earth when you come back to your normal life it feels like you don't know what reality anymore.
    
    
        
You don't know if this is the illusion or that world is the illusion; you cannot identify what is real.
        Copy



You don't know if this is the illusion but deception is very high; you cannot identify what is very real.
        Copy



The grace of God kept me from that.
        Copy



Let's go back to false paradises and NDE experiences people are having because I believe they're having these experiences but on the other hand what you're saying it's not genuinely paradise but created by Satan.
    
    
        
Like what you're saying it's not genuinely paradise but created by Satan.

He always talks about this woman who's, you know, coming to him at night. And he said, this woman is no ordinary. She's so beautiful. Like, very beautiful. This one is deep. So, somehow, every time, every night, he's going to the river. He's going to talk to that woman for hours and hours in that river. No one's seeing that woman. So, the parents thought, okay, maybe he's getting crazy. We go to the mental hospital.
        Copy



They brought him to the mental hospital. Well, the doctor there said, he's perfectly normal. He's perfectly fine. Nothing's wrong. Maybe he's just tired like that. But, you know, it progressed until such point. You know, that's another thing to look out when this is something to do with the spirit. The doctor couldn't find anything wrong about you. That's another thing. Because I always see this. I always see this in my mission or ministry, you know, in Philippines. That the doctor couldn't find something.
        Copy



So, now, that man, he just said, this is the last time we remember he said, he's going to get married to that woman. After that, he is somewhere now where he's talking to someone constantly and looking at. And then, you know, he has a certain place where he's just so happy. He's very, very happy. Now, he's in our world. Like, he's functioning his physical body here, but he's not here. His mind is someplace else.
        Copy



Yeah, yeah. I mean, and this is the doctor telling, he's perfectly normal before. But now, seeing him, he's not. And he's like digging, digging, digging. He just digs something from the forest. Something. It's like something ridiculous that this woman is trying to manipulate this man. And, yep, until his subconscious is not there.
        Copy



So, like what I said, that's very dangerous. Because you may come back, but you are somewhere out in the realm where your body is here, but your soul is trapped.
        Copy



Back to the NDEs, the near death. And then we'll move on a little bit now. So, are you saying that if someone sees their relatives, say a child that passed away or your mother or your grandmother or your husband that passed away, if you're dying and you see that, that's not God. But if you see angels or Jesus, then you know that's from the Lord.
        Copy



And also, I really wanted to encourage everyone to really get into the word of God, to pray, you know, worship, do this spiritual discipline. Because even though sometimes they said they are angel, you know.
        Copy



Okay, so maybe I need to tell you this, Jennifer. So, did you know some demons are naked? Like they are naked. I don't know why they are naked. Anyway, so this one, he said, I am Jesus, like that. And I'm like, no, you're not Jesus.
        Copy



This is like another thing. Sometimes the level of your spiritual assignment is the level of the devil's spiritual assignment that they're going to give to you. Like before, it's like a little demon and then now it's like this deception of fake Jesus.
        Copy



Okay, it's also all over the world now, this fake Jesus going on. Okay, I just wanted everyone to be aware of that. So I think it started this year. It's more kind of really going to be obvious this year.
        Copy



It's actually if you kind of really go to Bible because we need to be biblical. It's in Revelation. I remember the four horsemen, you know.
        Copy



And there's this white one that's running who says his piece and three and a half years there's false peace that's going to reign. So he said I'm Jesus I said no you're not Jesus.
        Copy



So when I started to do this by the blood of the Lamb of my Lord Jesus Christ my Savior my Protector like that suddenly he shifted he suddenly changed like he looks like a djinn you know a djinn?
        Copy



A djinn? What do you mean by djinn? Like a genie? Like he looks like a genie yeah but he's three feet he's three feet he has a very bulgy tummy and he's naked and then his eyes when he opened is pure black and he's very comical like he's kind of really doing something crazy.
        Copy



And I'm like also I was so mad at him you know I'm like so this is where I'm after my prayer you know because sometimes they attack you after you pray so this is prayer fasting I think yeah I remember when Jesus you know being tempted.
        Copy



So when I was about to grab him you know I was so mad at him I was about to grab him and he's suddenly gone you know he's afraid of the blood of Jesus Christ.
        Copy



Like what you said Jennifer we need to pay attention to also you know that you know that Jesus there is no doubt when it is Jesus it is 100% you know it's Jesus because he's the only one who can bring that presence the very pure presence of love that kind of pure kind of love.
        Copy



If you encounter that purity of that love the highest form of peace the highest form of peace is like something is like going around you and they say you know like the world is going to end.
        Copy



You do not care you just know that you're being held that peace beyond human understanding that joy that is the presence of Jesus Christ.
        Copy



If somehow someone you know your relatives or whoever going to drag you in their place and you had this doubt you know you have this you know like fear you know.
        Copy



You need to really pray because that's really something very concerning and dangerous yeah even the angel sometimes you know there was this like time that you know when the angel visited you when it comes from the Lord they also bring that kind of presence even though they look like a very serious type of angel because some angels really look like okay yeah like something you cannot mess up with.
        Copy



But you know it is the angel of God because they also had carried that light that presence of God but some angel that say angel like that sometimes you're kind of really they're not because sometimes they're just vile you know and you will really know it because they couldn't really kept the goodness they just couldn't do it they can act for a while but they just going to blow their whatever they made up yeah.
        Copy



So yeah I'm encouraged for everyone not to be deceived you know to really come to Jesus Christ and to really read your Bible once again really get into the word and the Holy Spirit ask the Holy Spirit to really understand what the word of God is those are basic but Jennifer those are really something that will going to lead us to not be deceived because nowadays this is actually what's going on is there's a very very fine line of truth.
        Copy



You know the deception nowadays is like a strand of hair that's how dangerous we are living in right now and they're working in any system in the world especially in the rich country in the regional system in government in everywhere they're just that influence and you know why it's happening because America in the history was once a Biblical grounded society and nation they loved the word of God.
        Copy



And then suddenly America turned into embracing the Eastern religion embracing all kinds of belief and in the Bible when Israel commit idolatry by turning away setting up altars this God or this entity fallen angels and many things they're being summoned.
        Copy



And nowadays everyone's starting to always build an altar if you notice that building on altars building on altars is summoning them and like going to new age movement about the universe and everything so that is really summoning them to come back.
        Copy



And that is people telling that they are refusing God and they're refusing Jesus Christ and if you notice the faith of the grateful always getting weaker and weaker in Christianity because we embrace again that different belief and it's very sad.
        Copy



And that's why I'm encouraging everyone Jesus Christ is the only specific address to heaven in first Corinthians chapter 13 no matter how you discover the mysteries you can speak the language of angels.
        Copy



You will know the deep knowledge of this world but if you do not have that love we gain nothing no matter how many amazing NDE we have if we don't have that Jesus Christ the pure highest form of love in this world we gain nothing that's what I can encourage everyone.
        Copy



Sandy Lynn so you gave your life to Jesus when you were 12 years old but yet you had these demonic encounters and there are some Christians who believe that once you become born again these things can't happen to you but why do you believe this happened to you giving your life to Jesus even when you were 12 years old?
        Copy



Yes like what I said Jennifer I gave my life to Jesus Christ when I was 12 I thought I accept him as my Lord and savior but I only accept him as my savior and not my Lord because for him to be the Lord of your life Jesus said if you love me you obey my command and that's where I don't have that in me I am a Christian yes.
        Copy



I am still the master of myself I'm still running my own show and doing my own way and becoming not only lukewarm but playing God and think that God will always understand another thing I want to also give importance is since I was 12 I really don't have the deep root and that's very important that biblical truth that foundation of the word that is the foundation of the word Jesus Christ is the word.
        Copy



And for us to grow in our faith we need to really always have the word the promises that we can we can really keep in our hearts and the word as the sword of the spirit it is our weapon in our daily life this earth is a constant battle.
        Copy



And I know during the time they got tired of fighting sometimes in our life Jennifer what I experienced I just got tired of fighting I just got tired of believing that God is real and God will do something about my life I just keep on doing my own way.
        Copy



And back when I was college I just don't think Jesus you're not so cool for my season now I just try to keep you for now and just looking back at that I just really feel Jesus if I only really take seriously of my faith I hold on to my faith I can do more for your kingdom.
        Copy



But it's never been too late and I just want to say to you as soon as you come back to him and repent like what I said I came from a pagan background grace is very unfamiliar to us for us to be validated there is always a sacrifice being a Christian is amazing because God did all the sacrifice 2000 years ago on the cross he gave me that submission surrender and obedience to his will.
        Copy



Now I am a beautiful masterpiece of God and my journey is not yet really there but God teaching me how to walk in really accepting him now as my Lord and Savior so Sandy Lynn take us to the time when you were escorted to heaven what did you see?
        Copy



You saw weapons but these weapons were not metaphorical yes I am very excited because this one just happened last year every year I am doing yielding to God and to the Holy Spirit is a key to really understand God in the book of Isaiah Jeremiah chapter 3 it says call unto me I will answer you and tell you great things that you do not know.
        Copy



I hold on to that if I keep on coming to God God will show me that year I am expecting something wonderful God what is this year for us?
        Copy



That is my question this is not an ordinary dream this is something special I thought I will keep this a secret sometimes Jennifer sometimes God said do not say this this is yours.
        Copy





To keep and let the time pass until it, you know, comes true but this one is okay. You need to tell this because this is not only for you but for the forerunners of faith. God emphasized to me first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 to 26, if I remember it right, about the forerunners, so I'm going to emphasize this story about the race.

In my dream, Jennifer, I saw this angel. I'm actually getting familiar with them because every time, every year, if God is going to do something in that year or I need to pray for certain places, certain people, or churches, God is going to show it to me or I will have a very special angel visitation. Like what I said, it is not for entertainment; it always has to do with advancing God's kingdom and his purpose. Glory to Jesus Christ.

They said, "I'm here." As soon as they said that, I was transported and I saw these four angels. I didn't forget them—they have no wings by the way—but they look so pure, kind, and meek but there's something about their authority. I think that's the right word—the authority that they have. It's like that kind of angel you do not want to mess up with. In that place, I felt like a child, like a very excited child because this is what they said to me: "You are in the training." That's what they said to me. I mean how many training sessions, you know? I think this is the third or the fourth time I heard them say that. So I said, "Okay, I'm in the training."

As I look and pay attention to the angel, I was just mesmerized by where I am. Inside me, I'm like jumping for joy. I was just so excited. I know what this is and I saw the room. I saw different swords and not a single one of them was the same. They are so uniquely designed in many ways. There's one thing I want you to know about certain things there in the room or in heaven in general: here on earth when we use a spoon or any non-living things, they are truly non-living—they're not breathing or anything—but in heaven, everything is alive. It's like the trees, the flowers, everything is alive.

All my years of being a missionary and walking with Jesus Christ I've always encountered Ephesians 6 about the armor of God. I thought that the sword of the spirit was a metaphor because it was something that you learn—like the belt of truth to protect you through truth so you will have confidence, gospel shoes, the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness, the shield of faith, and the sword of the spirit. So I thought all those were metaphors. But the angel explained to me that all the children of God have a very special sword designed for them.

I was so amazed because I was like "I never knew this was real!" Something that you really have in spiritual battle. When I saw them they weren't just on shelves or hanging; it's like they are alive! They are so bright and floating. The room felt full of joy—it’s hard to explain but they almost had personalities. It’s amazing how experiences like that allow you to understand and describe what you see so you can be a witness.

The angel then said, "Today we are going to give you a new sword." My joy doubled! Inside I was jumping for joy but I tried to remain proper facing this angel. Then the angel said, "But you need to pass a test." That caught me off guard. So then they asked me, "What's in your hand?" All of a sudden I realized I'd been holding a sword all along but it was so small, almost like a dagger. It looked worn out from many battles.
        Copy



They said in exchange for that worn-out sword, I would get a new one after passing the test. Everything happened so fast. They sat me down and gave me something that looked like a diamond crystal, pure and clear. They placed it inside me at my knee without any pain—very meticulous like the best surgeon without any discomfort.
        Copy



When they placed it in my knee, they said in times when I need help in the test they could come to the rescue quickly. As soon as they said that, we were at a place with two roads—this wasn’t heaven. From shadows and smoke emerged two humanoid figures—a man and a woman who were definitely demons but in human form. They were looking at each other fiercely.
        Copy



The angel said I was going to run a race with these two creatures and needed to win or else they would get my reward. Then without a countdown or anything, the race began. In that realm there is no element of time; we don’t use our feet but become light while running. These two demonic figures turned into shadow-like forms too.
        Copy



By God's grace, I won the race! When we returned to the starting place—two crossroads—the angel next to me said I had won. My reward appeared in my hand: it looked like a potter’s jug filled with oil. Holding the oil felt heavy and sacred; it made me bend my knee and kneel down in surrender before handing it over to the angel.
        Copy



Back at the artillery room again, relief washed over me. Despite knowing there would be bigger battles ahead—because why else would I be given a new sword—I felt regenerated and joyful again as four glowing swords soared towards me and stood in front of me.
        Copy



The first sword was ivory-colored, like milky white but glowing brightly. The handle seemed pure...
        Copy





Gold and has that you know like that gold that's kind of really arranged neatly you know that's kind of really um you know twist nicely you know that that's that's the first sword it's so beautiful it's just beautiful. And then the other one it looks like green emerald that's how I can describe it, it's like green emerald and it has that inscription it's like a language. But this one I really don't understand what's that it's like that language, I don't know because it's like a symbol, it's just a symbol, it's like a different language. And um, um, it also looks beautiful and the way when I say beautiful it's like a different level of beauty. Like this one looks like you know like um elegant, like refined, something like that you know.
        Copy



And this one, this green emerald, it looks like a deep ocean. It's like um it's just captivating, it's like shimmery you know, it's like when the ocean is shining when it's being heated by the sun something like that. It's just beautiful you know. And then the third one, this one really gets my attention because that one is pure crystal glass. It looks like diamond, I'm not sure if it's like pure crystal glass diamond, like the purity of that you can really see, you know the see-through because it's so clear. It's so beautiful and it has embedded different jewels, different gems, different stones and the stones really complement what that diamond sword looks like. It's so beautiful I'm like wow you're so beautiful, I'm like talking to the sword. It sounds crazy but I'm talking to these swords, that's how I can describe it.
        Copy



And then the last one um this one it looks um it's not really earthly material but it looks so okay so this is how I can describe it. You know when you see a mountain in the land, the grass and the mountain, like that kind of beauty you know when you see the field of land mountain grass that kind of beauty like we appreciate that. So that's what it looks like but it looks like um a material like leather, like a leather in our earth but it weaves. The weaving is, the detail of how it weaves tells a story; it's not just randomly weaves just because. It means every part of the weave tells a story and it has a very specific symbol why. Like God never creates something that doesn't have any purpose. He is the God of detail, he's just a God of detail; he's so detailed in this very very perfect way. It's just amazing. That's the beauty of this one.
        Copy



So, you know while they were standing and one thing I also noticed about them they are so bright, like shiny shiny bright; it's just hard to explain the brightness where it's so bright but at the same time you can really look at it. That kind of brightness isn't like it didn't hurt your eyes. And you know one thing that I noticed about this sword when I go to differentiate it to the sword here on earth: the sword here on earth when you hold it you know it's a weapon for killing, it's a weapon to slash or to draw on you know aim, you know like that. But the sword that I saw is alive, so it doesn't look really for use for maybe because if you're a child of God, um, it doesn't look scary or harmful. It just looks so gentle; it's like a friend. This I can say: it's like a sword, a friend; something like a sword that you want in your journey that you will never get bored of having because it's something that you know is so gentle. The sword that is so gentle, so joyful because they have different personalities because they look so joyful they look so you know pull up spark sort of bursting goodness in them.
        Copy



So that's the kind of sword that these four swords look like. And so when I was about to choose it Jennifer when I was about to get it I woke up. But the angels they're so gentle; they brought me gently in my body because I see glimpses every time they go sometimes. You know I had the chance to when I open my eyes I see a glimpse of light when they put me back into my room and I woke up like I'm holding something. I was like, and I was like you know like I got it. I'm just sorry to spoil you though they didn't tell me what did I choose. That's why even for me it's like they kept this as a mystery to me but what I can assure is I have it because as soon as I wake up I'm like a child, I get up and I'm trying to yes I have it. You know that you have it and then I was so excited.
        Copy



I'm going to confess this to you Jennifer when I read the Bible there are parts in the Bible that I'm really not interested in: like the bloodline, like the names you know. But as soon as I get this there's that deep deep hunger for the Word of God that when I read the bloodline I'm like wow tell me about it. I'm doing a lot of research about who this person is; like the bloodline of Jesus Christ, like what I said in Matthew chapter 1: 14 generations from Abraham to David; David to captivity in Babylon and Babylon going to Jesus' generation. And then you know I'm like oh wow I never see this before now Jennifer. Now I realize that if God puts something in there whether it looks boring for someone – like names or blood – God put in there for a purpose. God really put in there for a purpose and that opens me up to so many things that I never saw before. It's like a mystery.
        Copy



So when I open the Word of God and that's why I understand: okay so that's why it is the sword of the spirit. It's something that's going to have a purpose in me and now I'm sharing the message during Bible study and the Holy Spirit...it's like people will tell me "that's exactly pierced my heart" or "that's exactly the word I need". I'm like Holy Spirit; God this is you! Yeah that's what they said to me: "this is God". You just don't say it randomly; it's like you don't know what I'm going through but what you say that's exactly what I need and sometimes it became healing; that word of God.
        Copy



And sometimes it's just now I'm like: God who am I going to minister today? And God will exactly give me the right word and I'm amazed because it's not just saying something randomly; it also has a purpose in my daily life and with ministering to others. Now when I see people it's different; it's like God gave me a glimpse of how he feels when I look at people. They are lost, sick or dying; I always have that pain in me that makes me go somewhere silently or secretly and pray for that person. If I'm not going to pray for that person or church or community God will not let me sleep. So I see now God really loves not only children of God not only Christians He also loves the lost; He's been searching for them and the Holy Spirit is working hard in our generation because we are in God's grace period and there will come a time when it runs out.
        Copy



So the passion and compassion for the loss – that's the happiness I feel right now when I look at people –I feel like embracing them; feel like praying for them because of such deep love which I've never experienced before in my walk. As I've said before: I'm a missionary who's taken care of many children but this kind of love is different and now in this year that is God's calling. This is another thing Jennifer: God said share this because it is not for you alone but for all children of God who need to pick up their swords again.
        Copy



I must emphasize that: child of God, you need to pick up your sword because we are living in times where we need God desperately. It's a call to arms Jennifer; it's a battle as stated in 1 Corinthians 9:24-26: you are forerunners of faith and need to win this race with help from the Holy Spirit enabling us all to win.
        Copy



God's calling right now Jennifer is heavenly mindedness needed because Christians are becoming too earthly minded thus useless for heaven's kingdom purposes which grieves God's heart immensely seeing distractions pull Christians away from focusing on Him even if only an hour or minute each day could change things.
        Copy



So despite challenges regarding focus Christians face today needing God every day even briefly acknowledging these swords symbolize callings available upon repentance offering access into Jesus' kingdom making Christians responsible wielding swords positively rather than negatively slashing brethren rising above such tendencies focusing lovingly upon responsibilities praying endearingly towards transforming communities however challenging such walks remain gentle divine guidance proving uplifting fulfilling purposes across ministries akin alongside reconciliations realized even amidst initial difficulties akin reconciliation eventual soothing thereby demonstrating transformative inner workings – ultimately leading towards comprehensive deeper healings understanding unfolded forgiveness journeys toward eventual ministerial callings acknowledged effectively throughout.

Is like the image of God in me. Like I'm always asking, where were you when I was abused, when I was in pain, when I was being tortured, where were you? And that's my question with God. Maybe in the other story, I'm going to tell that but this time I wanted to end it that God really showed me, you know the miracle power of forgiveness and how before my dad died, 2016 when he died, that's where we got to reconcile, we got forgiveness and right now, Jennifer established five churches in Philippines two I got visit and they helped me in the ministry, you know. Some of them really active in helping me with the mission and the seeds that my dad planted, you know it's growing. He died but he left a legacy of Jesus Christ in the hearts of many homeless, drug recovery people. It's just a very amazing story that I really wanted to share.
        Copy



Is that something that I need or something I can say, I brag about, I work hard for this. All of my days of my life is only by the grace of God and that's how God made it clear to me that I will live under his grace because I am the monument of God's grace and this is how I wanted to end this. Amen.

Sandy, Lynn, could you end this out in prayer? Could you pray for everyone watching right now who have been through, even been through, I guess, what you've been through, if not worse or even better, you know, but could you just pray for them in their walk with Jesus and that they'll learn to obtain that sword that God had given them because God has given us armor but it's up to us to take up that armor. So could you just pray for them right now?
