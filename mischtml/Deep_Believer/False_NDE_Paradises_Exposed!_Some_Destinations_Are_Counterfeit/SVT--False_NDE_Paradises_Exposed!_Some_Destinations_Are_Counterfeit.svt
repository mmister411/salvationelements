1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.119
 Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.880
 This is Jennifer Bagnasi with Deep Believer.

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.700
 Our guest today saw heaven twice, once when she was young, the other when she was older.

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.440
 When she was older, she was actually escorted to the artillery room in heaven.

5
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.559
 Not only that, but she accidentally got wrapped up into witchcraft, and when she did, she

6
00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:36.000
 was actually taken into different realms through portals and tormented.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.799
 But not only that, she mentioned something that is happening right now.

8
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.180
 A lot of people are being taken into false paradises.

9
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.759
 People are having NDE experiences that actually are not from God, but they think they're in

10
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:51.759
 heaven.

11
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:56.479
 So she's here to explain why that is so, and she gives us detail.

12
00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.279
 Sandy Lin Taylor, thank you so much for being with us today.

13
00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:00.880
 Thank you so much, Jennifer.

14
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.439
 It is an honor to be here.

15
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.959
 And it is an honor to have you.

16
00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:11.559
 So Sandy Lin, you were actually raised in the Philippines, and you didn't have that

17
00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:12.599
 well of a childhood.

18
00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.599
 So tell us about your childhood.

19
00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:18.440
 So I will start when I was young.

20
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:28.400
 I was one and a half year old when my parents abandoned me because of poverty, and my dad

21
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.000
 is into drugs.

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.319
 And so they got separated when my mom was about to go to Saudi Arabia.

23
00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.639
 I was one and a half year old, and she just told me that she's going to buy candy in the

24
00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:41.639
 store.

25
00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:47.919
 But she didn't come back for years.

26
00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:50.680
 And that's the story that she told me.

27
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.239
 She honestly told me that she lied when she needs to go, but it's really painful on her

28
00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:58.239
 side too.

29
00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.959
 I was raised as a pagan, Jennifer.

30
00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:07.639
 So there's no person who's telling me who is Jesus about the Bible, about God.

31
00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:14.919
 So in Philippines, Jennifer, we are majority is Catholic, but I was raised as a pagan.

32
00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:21.639
 And being raised as a pagan, I grew up full of fears and anxiety.

33
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.160
 This time of my life is really hard for me.

34
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.119
 This is very, very hard, abandonment issues and all sorts of abuse.

35
00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:38.759
 So I'm not going to put in detail so much about it, but the abuse started when I was

36
00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.039
 really young.

37
00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.639
 It's somehow close to me, that person.

38
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:54.759
 And from there, everything started to get dark in my life and with the way I walk until

39
00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:55.759
 I grow up.

40
00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:06.080
 So at that time where I was a pagan and growing up with not having so much things, God already

41
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.039
 showed me this vision when I was five years old.

42
00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:17.220
 So this open vision is, I will never forget this, even until now, it's just amazing.

43
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.839
 So everyone was sleeping at this time, Jennifer, and we were in a very small apartment in Manila.

44
00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 And there's this window there on our room.

45
00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:31.000
 As soon as I wake up that early morning, I heard this music.

46
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.119
 It's really the one that captivates me.

47
00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:38.959
 It's the one that really draw me to go and look up on the sky.

48
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.720
 On that vision, the music keeps on playing.

49
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.679
 Just seeing what I'm seeing at that time, it's the first time I experienced that joy,

50
00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:50.679
 that love.

51
00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:58.240
 When I saw the man on the road, the image of him there on the sky, what really I couldn't

52
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.639
 forget is his eyes.

53
00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.279
 Even though he didn't speak to me, he's telling me that he's loved.

54
00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:11.199
 He's telling me that he's the embodiment of all the goodness and love of joy, that peace

55
00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.119
 that transcends human understanding.

56
00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.440
 It's the first time I experienced that.

57
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.040
 I thought it's an imagination or something, but it's because I'm confused when I was young.

58
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.000
 But it's very vivid.

59
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.679
 I could not forget that.

60
00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:28.920
 And then there's another instances.

61
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.160
 It also happened in the same place, in apartment, but I was outside at this time, Jennifer.

62
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.360
 And then suddenly I was, you know, because maybe I'm anticipating, expecting I will see

63
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.040
 another, you know, because I'm really after that amazing feeling.

64
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.519
 And so I look up again at the time and I saw this open heaven.

65
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:52.959
 It's like the cloud, it has a bursting colors.

66
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.919
 It's like gold, but then beyond that, there's like so many bursting colors.

67
00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.000
 It's so beautiful.

68
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.880
 And there's this river.

69
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.440
 And now that I'm a Christian, I read that in Revelation where I think it is the river

70
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.079
 of living water.

71
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:14.880
 I cannot describe in my human understanding how the place is.

72
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.239
 It's simply beautiful, but you know, it's alive.

73
00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:23.559
 It's something, something miraculous, something majestic about that place.

74
00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.279
 And then after those, you know, experience, I was, you know, I was actually jumping for

75
00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.679
 joy when, you know, my relatives things like, oh, you know, she's a child, she's just, you

76
00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:33.679
 know, playing around.

77
00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:38.679
 But I was like, there's someone in there, there's someone in there, there's living,

78
00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.839
 living in that place like that.

79
00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.600
 So after that experience, you know, I kept it in my heart.

80
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.639
 At a very young age, I already lost my innocence.

81
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.880
 And this vision, you know, that I was just seeing was just, you know, turn everything

82
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.600
 in my life dark.

83
00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.079
 So I went from different places, different people who, you know, will take care of us,

84
00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.760
 relatives and other neighbors and people.

85
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.559
 I want to emphasize this, Jennifer, that this is a very important role of the parents

86
00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:16.440
 that God entrusted us, which the mother is the sole protector of their children.

87
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.959
 The mother should be the one who pray fervently for their children.

88
00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:28.799
 And when the children don't have the parents to guide them, to protect them, they are open

89
00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:32.000
 for all kinds of attacks.

90
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.639
 Because that's what I experienced.

91
00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.359
 I've been sexually abused, molested with different peoples.

92
00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:43.279
 And at first, Jennifer, you know, I always feel that it's always my fault.

93
00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.079
 Like every time things happen, I always feel like it's my fault.

94
00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:53.399
 Because maybe, you know, I'm too weak to resist or I just, you know, couldn't do something

95
00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:54.399
 about it.

96
00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.839
 I cannot even speak up about it.

97
00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:00.959
 I just feel so guilty inside is how I feel all my life.

98
00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:06.679
 It's that that confidence in me, you know, and innocence in me, it's just gone.

99
00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:14.839
 There comes a point in my life that that fear turns into pain that at my young age, I already

100
00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.959
 felt, you know, that pain.

101
00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:23.480
 And at the time, I'm not only sexually abused, there's also verbally abused, you know, everyone's,

102
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.919
 you know, like, putting curses on you in a way that, you know, sometimes, you know, because

103
00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:30.839
 we're not too careful with words.

104
00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:38.199
 Yeah, we say so much things about this person is just going to be a nobody, you know.

105
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:41.160
 And I was really persecuted a lot when I was young.

106
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.760
 And then after that, you know, verbally abused, sexually abused.

107
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.079
 We also experienced some physical abuse, you know, and the worst of all the abuse is spiritual

108
00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:53.079
 abuse, Jennifer.

109
00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.079
 Yeah.

110
00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:56.519
 So, yeah, I'm surrounded with that.

111
00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:01.959
 At my young age, I saw so many things that a young child shouldn't see, like pornography.

112
00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:07.639
 And, you know, I was surrounded with everything that's going on in that environment.

113
00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:10.839
 And love and grace is very unheard.

114
00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.919
 Although this is how God kept me at that time.

115
00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:21.040
 This is how I see God really show mercy to me, even at those young years, Jennifer.

116
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.880
 God never removed that adventurous spirit of mine.

117
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.519
 I was watching this.

118
00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:30.480
 I'm sure you know this history or story.

119
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480
 It's Huckleberry Finn.

120
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.279
 I kind of really related to him because he's homeless like that and like, you know, the

121
00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.920
 freedom of adventure like that.

122
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.680
 And so when I was elementary, I saw this Four Faces of the Mountain, our teacher just taught

123
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680
 us.

124
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.480
 And in that book, I just touched the book and I said, someday, I'm going to go here.

125
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.880
 So, you know, I had this faith.

126
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.680
 God really put that so much faith in me.

127
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.680
 There's that faith in me that I just never gave up my dream.

128
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.800
 There's some stronghold in places.

129
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.880
 Whatever happened in that place, it opens a portal of something evil.

130
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:20.600
 Because that place in the province with my grandpa, we always welcome medium, witchdoctor

131
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.200
 and all kinds of paganism.

132
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.959
 We also, I saw them sacrificing animals.

133
00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:32.279
 I really don't understand, but I was a witness.

134
00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:34.760
 I'm just an observer at the time.

135
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:42.720
 So there was this time, this kind of God, nature spirits or whoever it is, got offended

136
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.920
 and you need to sacrifice a very specific kind of animal.

137
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.320
 A collar and everything.

138
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.280
 It's like, you know, that is a very cruel God, right?

139
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.920
 If you miss something with instruction, you're really in big trouble.

140
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920
 Yeah, so this is what happened.

141
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.680
 And after we sacrificed these animals, the blood, I'm not official at this time, but

142
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.240
 I didn't know the importance of blood, but at that time, they put blood of the animals

143
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.680
 over, you know, but it opens the portal, like what I said.

144
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.440
 Also, that's a place where many people were, you know, abused and, you know, because the

145
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.960
 Philippines has a lot of history about abuse and wars and, you know, so much things.

146
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.160
 So at that place where I sleep, Jennifer, I will never forget this.

147
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:41.080
 This is the first time I saw this look like a dark shadow smoke.

148
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.680
 That's how I can best describe it.

149
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680
 It's huge.

150
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.400
 And it's really coming closer to the house.

151
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.120
 But I'm not sure how this really worked because I was young at the time.

152
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:58.080
 But the only thing I remember is that entity looked like and the evil presence of that

153
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.080
 entity.

154
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:05.840
 It's like really like, it's not only goosebumps, it's like it's so thick.

155
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.720
 The presence is so thick, that's how I can imagine.

156
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.560
 And I couldn't forget his eyes because his eyes looks like hell.

157
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.160
 If I can describe it, it's like there's deep lava.

158
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.360
 That's the way I can describe it, it's like dark fire lava.

159
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.640
 It's like there's a realm inside his eyes.

160
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.040
 That's how I can describe that.

161
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.000
 I was paralyzed in fear when I was young and I was like, what is this thing I'm seeing?

162
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.640
 It feels like it goes on forever, that it keeps on just, you know, walking there closer

163
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.800
 and closer and then suddenly it's gone.

164
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.520
 And then I'm like, what's that thing?

165
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.720
 I felt like even when I was young, I'm seeing things a lot, but I cannot speak out about

166
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.480
 it because I feel like, you know, who will believe me?

167
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.480
 Something like that.

168
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.240
 After that experience, God has a plan and the enemy has a plan.

169
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.840
 God has sent like a minister angels or a guardian angels to us.

170
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:14.640
 And I also believe that the devil also sent another, you know, enemy to really guard or

171
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640
 watch us.

172
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640
 That's how I see it.

173
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.680
 Because this entity is something that I'm not seeing it every day, but every stages

174
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.920
 of like what I said, of my growing years, I'm seeing this thing.

175
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.400
 And just every time that thing appears, something big is about to happen to me.

176
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:37.080
 So after I see that, that's where things really get out of hand, Jennifer.

177
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.520
 The abuse, the pain and everything is horrendous.

178
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.800
 There's this instance where, it happens so many times, but there's this night where this

179
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.680
 auntie of mine, he hid us in the water tank.

180
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.640
 This is an empty water tank.

181
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.920
 This kind of water tank is not the water tank that is like, you know, it's made of like

182
00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920
 cement.

183
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920
 It's like cave.

184
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920
 It looks like cave.

185
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.160
 It's very dark, Jennifer.

186
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:11.680
 So my auntie put us there in that basin and she said to us, not any single word, you know,

187
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:18.600
 I don't know how, how, how we survive is by the grace of God that I am here.

188
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 Yeah.

189
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 Yeah.

190
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.080
 So those are, you know, just a few of those experiences that I have.

191
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.680
 I'm trying to, you know, make it fun, you know, to look fun, but at that time it's not

192
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.680
 fun.

193
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.440
 So how old were you when you were in a basin though?

194
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.080
 How old were you when you were in the basin?

195
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.920
 How long were you there for?

196
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920
 Yeah.

197
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:42.760
 I think if I will remember, because I, I don't really have a clear memory of this.

198
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.060
 This is just being told by my auntie.

199
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.060
 This is story to me.

200
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.040
 You know, when you were young, that's what she said.

201
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.480
 I hid you in that water tank, that empty water in the basin.

202
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.080
 So when she said this to me, I believe I'm around maybe six years old because five years

203
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.760
 old when I have a vision about the heaven and then six years old when we were transferred

204
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.080
 in the province.

205
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.800
 So I think at those timeline where, you know, it, it happened, it really happened.

206
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.280
 And like what I said, it doesn't come from my memory.

207
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.880
 I barely even remember it, but you know, my auntie, this is a story that she keeps on telling

208
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880
 me so many times.

209
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.200
 During those times, you know, I'm just, you know, this, this person, but God, in a way,

210
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.720
 he have a way of reminding me of how much he loves me, even at that time where I don't

211
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720
 know him.

212
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.399
 So when I was young, you know, since I don't have parents, the time where I really feel

213
00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:41.279
 like I'm a child is where after school we go swimming in the river, you know, like those

214
00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:47.000
 Huckleberry Finn, you know, story and hide and seek, you know, like playing with friends.

215
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Those are the happy moments.

216
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.960
 Kind of really distract me from what really going on with my life and how I was really

217
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960
 feel abandoned.

218
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.279
 But Jennifer, every time I saw an airplane that time.

219
00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:00.519
 I always feel that pain.

220
00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:04.159
 I feel like, you know, when was the time

221
00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:06.879
 I'm going to ride in there and I'll be with my mom,

222
00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:08.639
 looking up, you know, always looking up,

223
00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.959
 hoping, you know, that, you know,

224
00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:13.679
 I get to really have a real parents, you know,

225
00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:16.399
 just growing up, seeing other kids of mine

226
00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:19.199
 having, you know, a normal family.

227
00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:22.079
 And my life is really like, you know, not a normal one.

228
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:22.919
 So, yeah.

229
00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:24.319
 I know you said your mom left,

230
00:15:24.319 --> 00:15:25.439
 but what happened to your father?

231
00:15:25.439 --> 00:15:27.199
 I don't think you mentioned your father.

232
00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:30.440
 Yeah. So after they, they separated.

233
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.600
 So my, like what I said, my mom worked in Saudi Arabia.

234
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.960
 My dad, he went to Manila, to Makati.

235
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.800
 But it's like, I had no news about it.

236
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.199
 I had no idea what he looks like

237
00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:44.640
 because everyone says he's a bad man.

238
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.800
 He's a drug addict all his life.

239
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.960
 So that's how they describe it to me.

240
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.800
 Yeah. So, yeah.

241
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.559
 So I stay away from him.

242
00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:54.159
 So who did they leave you with?

243
00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:56.920
 With relatives, so many relatives.

244
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.760
 Sometimes neighbors.

245
00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.680
 So it really depends on, you know,

246
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.120
 where we're going to school

247
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.359
 or if the person still can handle us, you know?

248
00:16:05.359 --> 00:16:06.200
 Yeah.

249
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.999
 Did your mother ever tell you why she left?

250
00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:10.039
 Yeah.

251
00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:15.039
 She said when the point where my dad physically abused her,

252
00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:15.999
 like really hurt her,

253
00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:19.559
 because I think because of my dad's, you know,

254
00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:22.199
 doing this marijuana, you know,

255
00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:24.120
 so he's always in the spirit of, you know,

256
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.239
 jealousy and anger and suspicion.

257
00:16:26.239 --> 00:16:29.120
 And you can't even talk to any man

258
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.840
 because if my dad found out, yeah.

259
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.719
 So there's that physical abuse.

260
00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:36.440
 And also poverty is another reason

261
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.760
 because since my dad not providing anything,

262
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.760
 so she needs to step and find a good life for us.

263
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.040
 Those are what my mom keeps on always telling us,

264
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.000
 the reason why she needs to leave us.

265
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.840
 Yeah.

266
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.040
 But of course it doesn't really make sense to me.

267
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.800
 All I just understand is like the fear of, you know,

268
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.640
 just seeing her always leaving us, you know?

269
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.480
 Yeah, so.

270
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.719
 And I know you said that you were in the occult.

271
00:17:05.719 --> 00:17:08.520
 Is that because you saw people in the occult around you?

272
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.400
 In the occult around you?

273
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.359
 Yes, because they were our neighbors, Jennifer.

274
00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.719
 Because during that time when I was young,

275
00:17:15.719 --> 00:17:17.600
 I think it's around,

276
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.160
 I was born in 1984.

277
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.040
 So around nineties, something like that.

278
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.960
 Christianity is not so popular in our town.

279
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.160
 It's in the province in Philippines.

280
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.440
 So we deeply believe more in the elders.

281
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.800
 You know, the elder tell us a story about, you know,

282
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.440
 aswang and witch and, you know,

283
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.999
 those paganism practices.

284
00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:44.240
 You know, we were raised in a discipline

285
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.279
 where the parents is like,

286
00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.999
 okay, if you're not going to behave,

287
00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:48.440
 I'm going to give you to aswang.

288
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.079
 Something like that.

289
00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:52.880
 That's how we are being motivated by fear,

290
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.480
 you know, to really, you know, like behave.

291
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.640
 Yeah, so, yeah.

292
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.040
 So it was like growing up like that, it's crazy.

293
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.120
 And also we were exposed to like what I said, you know,

294
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.560
 we were inviting this medium to our house

295
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.840
 and tell us what's our future, our fate, you know,

296
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.840
 that which woman medium told me, you know,

297
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.760
 like I will never step any single, you know,

298
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.720
 place in my life.

299
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.720
 I'll just stay in that town

300
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.640
 and be married to a lowly, you know, nobody.

301
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.280
 And my life will be just, you know, a nobody.

302
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.520
 And that's my fate.

303
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.960
 And, you know, she don't only read that fortune telling

304
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.200
 to me, but to other kids too, you know.

305
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.440
 And I just feel like, you know, no, no,

306
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.200
 this is not my life.

307
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.840
 I have a dream and the dream is free and I'm going to fly.

308
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.680
 That's, I'm just saying, you know, in my heart,

309
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.520
 God never, you know, gave up that faith of mine,

310
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.600
 you know, to not really embrace that life.

311
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.640
 After this, Jennifer,

312
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.040
 this is one of the most special moment in my life.

313
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.280
 The very first time I was 12 years old,

314
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.280
 when there was this person in our province

315
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.639
 and he hold this Bible.

316
00:19:09.639 --> 00:19:11.199
 He shared about the gospel.

317
00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:13.999
 This is the very odd to me, this kind of belief,

318
00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:15.279
 you know, first time.

319
00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.999
 Of all the things that he said to us,

320
00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:19.959
 because he's teaching us about worship, you know,

321
00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:21.679
 I think it's Jesus who enthroned you.

322
00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.719
 That's the very first time I learned, you know.

323
00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:26.439
 And then of all the words that he said to me,

324
00:19:26.439 --> 00:19:29.719
 this is what really strikes me the most, Jennifer.

325
00:19:29.719 --> 00:19:33.959
 He said, you know, God can be your father.

326
00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:38.519
 At that time, I believe that God used that word

327
00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:42.519
 because that desperation of me having a father

328
00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:45.839
 is what really brings me to him.

329
00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:48.319
 I was really drawn, you know,

330
00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:51.399
 and I was so hungry to have that father, you know.

331
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.679
 I want to experience what it feels like.

332
00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:57.719
 And so a prayer of a 12-year-old girl is this.

333
00:19:57.719 --> 00:20:02.719
 I said, God, if you're real, like what this man says,

334
00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:06.159
 and you can be my father,

335
00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:07.960
 can you be my father?

336
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.400
 And that word goes up to the throne in heaven.

337
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.759
 Until this day, I know God remembered that prayer

338
00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:18.439
 of that 12-years-old girl.

339
00:20:18.439 --> 00:20:23.039
 Because as soon as I started to pray

340
00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:26.240
 and learn how to pray to him,

341
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.039
 that's where the journey of, you know,

342
00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:33.599
 having him as my dad all through this journey of my life,

343
00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.119
 that's where everything started, you know, Jennifer,

344
00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:38.839
 to be something beyond beautiful.

345
00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:41.439
 But there's a problem here.

346
00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:43.479
 The problem here is this.

347
00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:46.800
 I accept him at the time as my savior,

348
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.720
 but not as my Lord,

349
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.040
 because since I just heard about this,

350
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.000
 I'm not deeply rooted in the word.

351
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.800
 So it's very important to a Christian growing

352
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.560
 that we are really deeply rooted in the word of God.

353
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.040
 It reminds me of the sower, you know?

354
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.440
 Like, if it's not really deeply rooted,

355
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.840
 like, it's so easily,

356
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.680
 the devil could easily really take away, you know,

357
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.560
 those seeds that's been planted on my heart at the time.

358
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.240
 So at first, my relative,

359
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.120
 they just let me, you know, go attend that Bible study,

360
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.760
 because they think it's not going to bring harm

361
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.480
 to the belief that we have.

362
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.080
 So at the time, they think it's like a season, you know,

363
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.320
 like it will pass, you know,

364
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.360
 because we have a passion, you know?

365
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.120
 And then suddenly that child will change their hobby.

366
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.080
 So they think it's just like that.

367
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.400
 Then I'm bringing the Bible in the house,

368
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.920
 and they really mock me.

369
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.040
 They're really laughing.

370
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.520
 And then, you know what I said to them, Jennifer?

371
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.840
 I was silly-ass,

372
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.560
 but this came really from my heart.

373
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.400
 Sincerely, I said,

374
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.800
 hey, guys, I'm born again now.

375
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.400
 I have a born-again experience.

376
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.240
 I'm born again.

377
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.200
 I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior.

378
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200
 I said that.

379
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.600
 And so they're really laughing and really mocking at me,

380
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.640
 you know?

381
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.480
 Sometimes when I pray, you know?

382
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.240
 But this is where they started to really feel

383
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.040
 uneasy and uncomfortable about it,

384
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.040
 because that child that is feisty and mean,

385
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.280
 I'm sorry, I think I didn't have the chance to tell you.

386
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.840
 So when I was young, I grew up very rebellious.

387
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.840
 I'm very feisty.

388
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.400
 I'm always in the street fights, you know?

389
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.120
 I grew up hating men, you know?

390
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.960
 But somehow I am starting to have this identity crisis

391
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.320
 because I was raised by a military, you know?

392
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.480
 So my training is tough.

393
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.960
 And then my cousins, you know,

394
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.120
 I'm surrounded with men.

395
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.000
 So I grew up hating men,

396
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.280
 but at the same time, you know,

397
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.480
 I was really into fights, you know?

398
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.680
 A lot of time into fights, you know?

399
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.400
 And there's this time when I was about to graduate

400
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400
 when I was in elementary.

401
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.400
 I almost not graduated

402
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.000
 because I really hurt this classmate of mine.

403
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.520
 I don't know if you had this when you were young.

404
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.520
 So he had this, we had this game

405
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.000
 and he lifted my skirt in front of many people.

406
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.320
 And that really, you know,

407
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.880
 drives me to really bang his head on the metal pole.

408
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.480
 And then as you know, I see there's an ambulance

409
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.200
 and my teacher was not so happy.

410
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.040
 You know, that's how worse I am, Jennifer,

411
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.840
 before Jesus found me.

412
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.680
 So they feel like uneasy to me.

413
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.000
 Like what happened to the one I trained as, you know,

414
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.200
 to be like, you know, like a tough military, you know,

415
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.280
 you know, woman, you know, like this?

416
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.280
 She became tame and she's now smiling,

417
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.800
 having this joy, you know, something odd about her,

418
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.639
 you know?

419
00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:52.320
 So maybe they kind of really sense this,

420
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.400
 this Bible studies getting into her.

421
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.600
 And then one Sunday I was ironing my clothes,

422
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.720
 going to church.

423
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.639
 And then they said, hey, where are you going?

424
00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.079
 I said, I'm going to church.

425
00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.120
 You cannot go there.

426
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.639
 Those people are bunches of crazy people.

427
00:24:05.639 --> 00:24:07.680
 They're raising their hands, they're crying.

428
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.720
 And then later they will laugh like that.

429
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.800
 So they think Christianity,

430
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.280
 in the perspective of a pagan is like, you know,

431
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.439
 what are they doing?

432
00:24:17.439 --> 00:24:18.960
 They're raising their hands, they're crying.

433
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.560
 They have this God is like an idea.

434
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.199
 God is just like that idea.

435
00:24:23.199 --> 00:24:24.400
 You know, it's like,

436
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.520
 like they think we were on drugs or something.

437
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.600
 Yeah, this is, this is my relative state, you know?

438
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.199
 So do not go to that church, you know,

439
00:24:33.199 --> 00:24:34.879
 they influence you, you know,

440
00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:37.000
 and brainwash you or something.

441
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.840
 But I said, I'm going there.

442
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.079
 I just want to go there.

443
00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:41.599
 Why do you want to go there?

444
00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:43.999
 And after that, that fight really got,

445
00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:45.559
 ended up badly because, you know,

446
00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:48.159
 there's kicking and I couldn't even finish the ironing

447
00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:49.639
 because, you know, I got beat up.

448
00:24:49.639 --> 00:24:52.720
 And because this person is bigger than me and he's a man,

449
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.639
 so I was crying.

450
00:24:53.639 --> 00:24:56.439
 And so they said, you cannot go to that church.

451
00:24:56.439 --> 00:24:58.319
 If we found out you're going there,

452
00:24:58.319 --> 00:24:59.999
 you're going to be beat up, you know, like that,

453
00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:02.079
 or we'll lock you in your room, something like that.

454
00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:04.439
 I was really sad that time,

455
00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:05.999
 but this is what I did, Jennifer.

456
00:25:05.999 --> 00:25:07.679
 So I have a clothes,

457
00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:10.119
 I prepared it, put it in my bag

458
00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:11.919
 and I sneak it on the window.

459
00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:14.319
 And then I go around at the back of the house,

460
00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:16.199
 but I said to them,

461
00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:18.759
 hey, I'm just going to play with my, you know,

462
00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:20.199
 with my friends.

463
00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:23.359
 It kind of really goes on for a while, you know,

464
00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:26.319
 like sneaking, going to church.

465
00:25:26.319 --> 00:25:29.359
 I mean, I have a different childhood

466
00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:31.759
 because I think I heard some kids,

467
00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:34.799
 they escape going to some kind of party.

468
00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:37.720
 But me, I tried to escape going to church.

469
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.919
 That's really, you know, amazing.

470
00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:43.119
 And because of this hunger for a father,

471
00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:45.159
 that's really, I'm really after, you know,

472
00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:46.400
 I want to experience this.

473
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.639
 When they found out about my sneaky, you know,

474
00:25:50.639 --> 00:25:52.159
 the thing that I did,

475
00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:55.639
 I recall I was locked up, really locked up.

476
00:25:55.639 --> 00:25:56.840
 I cannot go to church.

477
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.840
 And so I went to one of the members or pastor,

478
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.720
 some elder of the church

479
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.400
 and I said, could you please ask my uncle

480
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.600
 if he can let me go to your church?

481
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.759
 Maybe he listens to you because you're older.

482
00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:15.000
 I was so desperate.

483
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.040
 And then, so they went to my uncle

484
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.680
 and they were so scared because, you know,

485
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.199
 he's really, you have that authority figure,

486
00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:24.000
 you know, as a, you know.

487
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 And so he said, no, he's not age 18.

488
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.840
 18, until that time, he cannot decide for himself.

489
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.320
 We will be the one who will, you know,

490
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.120
 raise him the way we want it

491
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.880
 and the way how, you know, we want for her to.

492
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.639
 So that person said to me, I'm sorry,

493
00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:45.680
 but you need to obey them

494
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.639
 because they are your, you know,

495
00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:49.440
 authority figure for now.

496
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.920
 That really breaks my heart into pieces

497
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.120
 because I feel like God let me down.

498
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.079
 I was like in my room and like, I thought you're good.

499
00:26:58.079 --> 00:27:00.960
 I thought you can be my father.

500
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.960
 Why are you staying like my parents?

501
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.800
 You also don't love me.

502
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.079
 You also don't want me.

503
00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:10.120
 All of you just always want to abandon me.

504
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.240
 You're all the same.

505
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.800
 And I was really like so let down.

506
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.720
 I feel so let down by God.

507
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.520
 But then hearing that 18, so I said, okay,

508
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.920
 I'm going to give it a chance.

509
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.760
 If I'm 18, I will try to come back to you again.

510
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.520
 That's what I said.

511
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.440
 But, you know, those promises I forgot

512
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.920
 because after that, I became worse, Jennifer.

513
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.080
 I don't want to hear about, you know, Jesus

514
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.560
 or about this Bible.

515
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.720
 I was just really, you know, full of hate and pain.

516
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.720
 And then the abuse continue, sexual abuse,

517
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.720
 actually more happened when, you know,

518
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.439
 I reached the age where I'm, you know,

519
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:54.720
 starting to be a lady.

520
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.639
 It's just, you know, an ever-ending pain

521
00:27:56.639 --> 00:27:59.359
 and darkness and, you know, torture.

522
00:27:59.359 --> 00:28:02.999
 That's how I feel at the time I was high school.

523
00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:04.960
 I was very rebellious, you know.

524
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.160
 This age where 17 years old, Jennifer,

525
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.239
 this is another turning point in my life

526
00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:13.079
 because there are two highlights

527
00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:15.720
 that happens to me in this time.

528
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.160
 So the first one I'm going to tell you is

529
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.479
 I met this friend of mine and she's beautiful.

530
00:28:23.479 --> 00:28:27.639
 I never know she is, she's in a weekend group.

531
00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.879
 Since, you know, college, you know,

532
00:28:29.879 --> 00:28:33.759
 sometimes we have this playing Spirit of the Glass.

533
00:28:33.759 --> 00:28:34.960
 I don't know if you're aware of that.

534
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.520
 Yeah, it's like, you know, Ouija boards,

535
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.400
 you know, those cool stuff thing

536
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.119
 that we thought were cool when we were young.

537
00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:44.039
 Wait, so you guys play with Ouija boards in school?

538
00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:47.319
 When we don't have class, you know.

539
00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:48.759
 Actually, it's not Ouija.

540
00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:51.799
 In Philippines, majority of what we have there

541
00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:53.720
 is Spirit of the Glass.

542
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.280
 What is that?

543
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.639
 We made a board.

544
00:28:56.639 --> 00:28:59.799
 We, it's like a made up pulp board.

545
00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:02.359
 We just made it up, you know, we buy the materials.

546
00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:04.960
 And then we use the glass and the glass,

547
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.039
 the soul or the trap, you know,

548
00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:09.720
 as we believe is the soul

549
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.999
 that's going to be trapped in that glass

550
00:29:12.999 --> 00:29:17.160
 will be the one who will drive that facility.

551
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.359
 So I wanted to give warning to all the young people,

553
00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:25.359
 you know, just do not accept things that, you know,

554
00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.720
 you think it's cool or something,

555
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.439
 because especially nowadays,

556
00:29:28.439 --> 00:29:31.520
 there are really many satanic influence, you know,

557
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.639
 and they're always after young people and young kids.

558
00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.400
 So this friend of mine.

559
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:42.640
 um she really looked innocent but she gave me this paper it's just an ordinary paper jennifer

560
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:48.320
 and then she told me hey you want something cool you read this tonight i was like okay

561
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.320
 and it's like you know we're hungry for you know for you know something um power or something

562
00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:02.160
 magic you know so cool something like that so that night i read that chant it is a chant

563
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.920
 the way it's right it's a chant and now um going back i just opened my bible and i see the name

564
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:18.160
 of that thing that i summoned i didn't realize and jennifer this is no ordinary demon it's

565
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.960
 something it's it's in the bible actually paul mentioned that yeah i don't want to say her name

566
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:30.880
 so when you say you mentioned this chant this is how you accidentally fell into witchcraft because

567
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.960
 your friend gave you this paper to i guess speak aloud and you did it yeah he came out no

568
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:43.600
 that's another thing about um about interesting about um these entities when they come and visit

569
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:50.640
 you they're always sending someone you know like like like it's different this this night

570
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.760
 different this night so i don't know maybe on my experience based on my experience

571
00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:03.680
 somewhere of all these spirits i saw i think i got to see her but but i'm really

572
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:09.920
 definitely 100% sure when i started that and i summoned you know the name

573
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:15.200
 nothing happened you know it's like i just read it like a normal you know thing nothing happened

574
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:22.000
 okay you know i was actually waiting anticipating when nothing happened and then after that night

575
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.160
 and the next following night i was college at this time this is something beyond me jennifer

576
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:34.880
 i didn't realize i opened a portal because like what i said i grew up as a pagan and sometimes

577
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.840
 they made us drink this latin paper they roll it and they make us drink it you know um so many you

578
00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:49.760
 know paganism you know practices so i'm so not really you know like unfamiliar with this so i'm

579
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:55.600
 so used to those so that's why for me just reading this is like something i don't know how that this

580
00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:03.600
 is a big deal though so at the time as soon as that portal opened they just come sometimes by

581
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.200
 group sometimes one and you really sense the evil presence it's like if i will describe this

582
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.560
 this evil presence okay it's also they have different although they are evil and their

583
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:22.000
 presence is evil the level of the evil presence is different like some are really way thicker way

584
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.400
 um bigger you know like like you know that the level of their their evilness or their powers

585
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:35.840
 you know like you kind of just sense it that's how i can describe it i actually um really started to

586
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:43.920
 not going to college at time because i feel like my mind is going insane like i feel like i'm going

587
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:50.160
 to lose it and like my mental stability is not good anymore i'm not on drugs jennifer even though

588
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:56.960
 you know i i'm exposed to to alcohol drugs or being cool kid i'm not i'm not into drugs that's

589
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.480
 why it's very very clear to me of what i see is i mean of what i saw is what i saw because like

590
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:08.080
 what i said i'm clean i'm not into drugs at the time when um that happens every night i have a

591
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:15.360
 nightmare i have a nightmare and at this time i'm not aware about astral projection it's not being

592
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.600
 i'm not educated about astral projection but i didn't realize i'm doing an astral projection

593
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:28.560
 at that time it's like you know i was way too advanced you know because um sometimes in my house

594
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:35.520
 in our house you know i was just sitting and somewhere my body is going to be lifted

595
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:44.240
 and it's just like a blink and i was in this place that's how how fast and how crazy it is

596
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:53.520
 um and there's this instance that i was college at this time so i'm the very first in that room

597
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:59.280
 in my classroom so i'm waiting for my teacher and for my classmates so while waiting i just you

598
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:06.480
 know sit on my teacher's desk and i didn't realize i fell asleep and they said to me 45 minutes

599
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:12.160
 i'm unconscious like no matter what they did they couldn't just wake me up and they said

600
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.920
 what's just going on with you you know and then my classmates just making a joke like

601
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.480
 you know do that next time so you know we'll have no you know class we will have you know

602
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:26.560
 class interruption something like that but they never realized you know i at the time they are all

603
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:33.760
 laughing you know they think i'm just i'm just tired but they don't know like i was so serious

604
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:42.160
 at that time and i was like i couldn't stop it and you know the difference about that being visited

605
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:51.120
 by those demons you just feel somewhere inside you it's been trespassed and you kind of even

606
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:58.400
 couldn't shake it off that filthy feelings like you're being um spiritually abused or

607
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:06.000
 it's just dirty that's how i feel it's just nasty that's this that's how i feel um that time

608
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.720
 when my classmates trying to wake me up i was actually like you know in a different place

609
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:17.200
 this realm that i saw the first the first realm that i saw i couldn't forget this place it looks

610
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.600
 like there's no sky can you imagine that there is no sky but it looks like somehow like a glass

611
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.640
 on the top but it's not a glass that we have here on earth it's like something

612
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:36.800
 watery looking material that's what it looks like and there's this um dead tree and you know

613
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.560
 what in the bible in genesis i don't know god really has something to do with the tree i don't

614
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:48.640
 know why because like in in the time adam and eve um there's the tree of good and evil you know

615
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:54.080
 and there's the tree of knowledge you know and even in heaven there is the tree you know of life

616
00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:00.000
 so there's in this realm it's very striking to me i saw this tree as like this huge dead tree

617
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.600
 on that place it's very cracked and it's very dry and every time i try to run it's like it's like

618
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.640
 you're trapped in that realm it's like every time you try to run you go back to the beginning

619
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:20.080
 it's it's it's so um it's so paranoid it's so paranoid you keep on running to try to find an

620
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:26.080
 escape and then you always go back to the exact place where you are the dry the the dry crack

621
00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:32.480
 place in the tree and it's just the tree is like everywhere i run the tree is always there is that

622
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:38.320
 just that enchanting giant dead tree i couldn't forget that so that's the first experience i had

623
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:44.880
 with that realm the second one i was college just this time also and this happened in in my room you

624
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:50.960
 know i'm doing a siesta um siesta i'm not sure if you're familiar with that it's like an afternoon

625
00:36:50.960 --> 00:37:00.080
 nap was it yes yes we call it chest that's like a spanish okay yeah so it's an afternoon nap we we

626
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:07.200
 you know if you grow up in a tropical country most of us we do that you know afternoon nap so yeah so

627
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:14.320
 i do that afternoon nap as i believe this place that i saw is hell this is how i see it as i

628
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:22.480
 describe it so i thought i was still in our house i thought so i thought i opened the door of our

629
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:30.640
 house outside it's a different world i'm like what where is this i was really confused and suddenly

630
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:37.920
 on the sky i saw this it looks like i thought it's a bird that's what i thought but in the realm

631
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:43.280
 jennifer you have that vision where even though it's far you can see it clearly you know i don't

632
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:49.040
 know how i can describe it it's like your vision is so intense so even though it's very far when

633
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:54.800
 you look at and you're drawn to it it gives you the detail i what this is what i saw i am surrounded

634
00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:01.760
 the sky the sky was surrounded with this it looks like a giant bird but they look like evil they

635
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:10.240
 have this like you know like very like claw like sharp claw they look like a human bird that's how

636
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.920
 i can you know depict it but they're evil you know their presence and they're hovering all over

637
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:25.760
 the sky it's so dark and then this place is gloomy misery all like all kinds of sadness loneliness

638
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:32.560
 that you can ever imagine that never have on this earth but the atmosphere of that place is so heavy

639
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:39.680
 when i go to go and you know like look at that place you know when i look at the place i was in

640
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.880
 my house and then suddenly i saw i'm i'm on at the center of the ground of that place that's how

641
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:52.000
 how crazy it is you know it's like uh you know in spiritual realm it's like if you are not permitted

642
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.680
 to go there it's like how i can describe it's like you are an illegal you know you are an illegal

643
00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:03.440
 alien you know like you had no idea i mean just imagine this jennifer like if someone you know

644
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:10.000
 do an illegal thing you know going from other borders and you know there's some danger in that

645
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.079
 can you imagine if that is it's just like just the same different culture but you're still on earth

646
00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:24.159
 but can you imagine you're in a different realm how dangerous is that how dangerous is that

647
00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:31.919
 oh wow like i was like the grace of god really kept me from this day so um i when i saw that

648
00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:40.879
 i was there at the center of the ground and i saw this lots of souls lots of people i cannot say

649
00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:45.919
 they are people i feel like somehow they are already dead i don't know it's just like you

650
00:39:45.919 --> 00:39:51.759
 have an inner knowing you just have an inner knowing in that place so at that place you have

651
00:39:51.759 --> 00:39:58.879
 the inner knowing that those are dead like these people are dead and they were wearing ragged

652
00:39:58.879 --> 00:40:06.159
 clothes like very dirty like their robe is like like their their clothes at that time it's just

653
00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:12.079
 so so dirty their face is so this is what they look like when you look at them they're like in

654
00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:20.559
 a trance they're like in the deep deep sleep but all of them have shackles and there's this

655
00:40:20.559 --> 00:40:27.759
 huge angel and this angel is not heavenly angel jennifer this is like a guardian of that place

656
00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:36.559
 it looks so dark and i think i saw this um when i was young college i saw it in harry potter

657
00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:43.599
 this kind of creature it looks like some kind of having a like i don't know if he it's like a

658
00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:50.640
 shadow with the hood but he looks like a shepherd because it's like this soul is like he is the

659
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:57.760
 flock like this soul is a flock and this guardian is the the guardian of the soul that's going

660
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:03.919
 leading like he's leading them to their doom that's how it looks like so that's how so i was

661
00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:11.280
 like screaming and i was like guys like wake up and like i'm trying to like stop stop i'm trying

662
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:19.280
 to do that because all of them is going into this big dark mouth it's like a cave a mouth for

663
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:26.479
 i just cannot describe that place it's hell it's hell and they are falling one one one at a time

664
00:41:26.479 --> 00:41:31.200
 they're falling and falling and and they just couldn't stop it because they're in a trance

665
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.000
 they're like in deep deep sleep and they were they don't realize they're falling so i was like

666
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.799
 screaming but i was like even though i'm in this realm it's like i'm in a place where i am

667
00:41:42.799 --> 00:41:50.000
 in um how can i say it's like it's like where you were you put a fish in the aquarium so i was like

668
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.120
 i was in that in that living room but i couldn't do something about it because i was like held in

669
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:04.080
 that it's like a imaginary glass or something i i was like stop stop stop i was trying to you know

670
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:11.599
 to tell it but they're like falling falling falling i was like oh wow like i was screaming

671
00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:17.839
 i was running and then i got back back home i was like i i just think i need to go back home

672
00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:24.719
 and then suddenly i just go back home you know that how crazy it is you know in the other realms

673
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:31.520
 like your thoughts is the way you travel it's different it's way different so as soon as i

674
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:39.599
 got back home i couldn't remember how i i come back to my body i think i screamed jesus but

675
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:45.120
 it's really not clear to me how i came back but i all i know is from this day it's by the grace

676
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.479
 of the god i came back to my body and as soon as i came back to my body the first thing that

677
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:57.359
 comes to my mind is to drink water i'm very very thirsty and it's like my whole nerves and i was

678
00:42:57.359 --> 00:43:06.160
 like i feel so tired very very exhausted like i run a marathon like for how many you know many

679
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:12.400
 days that's how i feel i'm very very tired so what do you think that tree was according to my friend

680
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:20.560
 which is a weekend you know it has something to do with like a ritual when they're being summoned

681
00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:29.440
 you know this is how i can say in the realm so in our in our um earth before you transport to a

682
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:36.640
 certain place there is an airport right we have an airport where we land remember like so that's

683
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:44.799
 where you get the ticket and going to that certain place okay as the best as i can describe it that

684
00:43:44.799 --> 00:43:52.799
 tree is like a place where you know like before you go to another portal or another door it's like

685
00:43:52.799 --> 00:44:00.400
 that's a door that's a place where you know you get to see and it's interesting about the druids

686
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:08.720
 because they love studying about the trees they're fond of those trees yeah and so um like one of um

687
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:12.799
 this um friend a friend of mine who's now a christian and

688
00:44:12.799 --> 00:44:19.839
 you know, really passionate for Jesus Christ. She said that she always saw that tree also,

689
00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:25.519
 like a different level of that and that's why she said it's like a portal going to a different

690
00:44:25.519 --> 00:44:30.719
 place, a different realm. It's like a place where you're kind of like a nothingness. It's

691
00:44:30.719 --> 00:44:35.759
 like a nothingness generally. It's like a place like an airport where you land first before you

692
00:44:35.759 --> 00:44:40.719
 go to some certain, you know, they are also organized in Rome. They're more organized than

693
00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:49.999
 us, you know, because, you know, it's just how things work. It's just beyond me. That's how I

694
00:44:49.999 --> 00:44:56.159
 can say that time. And I was just a, I just, everyone thought I'm a normal college student.

695
00:44:56.159 --> 00:45:03.599
 Were you astral projecting and having any of these creepy visions before you did this,

696
00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:07.439
 that chant that your friend gave to you? Yeah, that's where it started.

697
00:45:07.439 --> 00:45:11.679
 So before then you didn't have those, you just had the experience of you when you were five

698
00:45:11.679 --> 00:45:17.759
 seeing heaven. Yeah. It's just like some random event that I will just get to see and experience,

699
00:45:17.759 --> 00:45:27.280
 but I think it became so, so deep in me because Jennifer, I wanted also to,

700
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.880
 for everyone to know this, the generational bloodline of what I have,

701
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:38.880
 the generational curse is real. It's in the Bible. It's happened from first generation to

702
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.680
 fourth generation that it's never been caught and never been freed by the blood of Jesus Christ.

703
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:49.120
 And having not come to the relationship of Jesus Christ, this will go on. And like what I said,

704
00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:55.040
 I grew up as a pagan. So, you know, so it means that as soon as I opened the chant,

705
00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:05.600
 I already have that deep level of ancestral connection about all these things. That's how

706
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:14.400
 I can think why this became so deep when I opened that portal because of the ancestral rights and

707
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:22.160
 the legal rights of the enemy, you know, from the generation before my forefathers to us.

708
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.120
 Yeah. Our generation. Yeah. And I'm glad you mentioned that because a lot of people don't

709
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.800
 understand that generational curses are real and that the reason why we do experience some things

710
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.480
 that we do is because of the generational curses that say our parents or our grandparents or great

711
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.040
 grandparents or a great, great. So could you just explain a little bit about generational curses?

712
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:48.080
 So our audience is aware that this is real. So the generational curses it's been mentioned in

713
00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.120
 the Bible, it's actually in the Old Testament, right? That the first generation to the fourth

714
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:59.600
 generation, if, you know, you've been practicing, worshipping, you know, the idolatry, different

715
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:07.280
 gods. So the curses or the wrath, it will be from first to fourth generation. And it's a make or

716
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:16.480
 break. That's why, okay, I'm going to explain this in the Bible from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob.

717
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:22.800
 You see, there is a, it's not really a deep, because they worship God, they are really faithful

718
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:30.720
 to that. But the sin, okay, let's just say it's that sin. Okay. So from Abraham, you know, that

719
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:38.560
 sin passes through Isaac into Jacob, you know, like Abraham lied, Isaac lied. And then Jacob became

720
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:45.520
 worse, you know, you see how it got deeper. So he betrayed. And the fourth generation, which is

721
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:52.720
 Joseph, like isn't really in a bad, bad place, because for him, you know, for that to happen,

722
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:58.560
 you know, yeah, so that's why, you know, it's been, you know, in slavery and abandonment, like

723
00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.840
 so much things happened to him, but he never did anything. But, you know, God break the curse,

724
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:10.640
 and that generational curse, through the time of Joseph, when you know, yeah, there are five tests,

725
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:18.320
 Jennifer, there are five tests in the life of a child of God, the test of time, the test of faith,

726
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:24.320
 the test of purity, the test of forgiveness, and the test of love. And with what happened to Joseph

727
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:30.719
 is the test of purity, and he passed that, you know, it's amazing, you know, so that's just,

728
00:48:30.719 --> 00:48:36.640
 it's not really, you know, a curse we're talking about here. It is just a sin. I mean, not just,

729
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:41.200
 sorry, because sin is a really big thing. I mean, it's serious. I don't want them to take it lightly.

730
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.480
 So yeah, I don't want it to be misunderstood. But what I mean is, they didn't do idolatry, but

731
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:53.520
 they sin, and that's what happened. It passes, you know, and if it was being cut off from the

732
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:59.200
 first to the next following generation, it will be a blessing, you know, like it's a blessing, you

733
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.800
 know, that's also what the Bible mentioned, remember? Yeah, so that's why, you know, in the

734
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.160
 Davidic timeline, in Solomonic timeline, with David, there's lots of fights, you go into a lot of

735
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:15.920
 fights, you know, and then by the time he didn't pass to Solomon, you know, it's like a time of

736
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:22.880
 peace in the kingdom, because the word is obedience. I think that is the best word is that

737
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:29.440
 obedience and, you know, our full devotion to the one true God, which is Jesus Christ. And with

738
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.960
 my ancestral, like what I said, the Christian generation that we have, I mean, a lot of stuff.

739
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:40.720
 I mean, in our town, there's this, you can search it also on YouTube, like someone's dancing on the

740
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:46.560
 fire. I mean, you know, like those are, you know, like they summon demons to do that. And when I was

741
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:53.520
 young, I couldn't forget this one where I saw this woman, he counted something, and immediately that

742
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.480
 possessed lady, the spirit transferred to the animal. And of course, they need to kill the

743
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.640
 animal immediately. So as soon as they kill the animal immediately, something come out from it.

744
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:09.840
 I was just like, what is that? I just saw it. I was just so scary. I was so scared at that time,

745
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.960
 like, oh, wow, this is real. So by the time I was young, I already know that they're existing.

746
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:21.040
 And the evil exists, you know, even they want to make us look that they're just a figure of

747
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.640
 imagination, but not where I grew up. That's why when I believe in God, I know that I know that

748
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:34.800
 he's real. Because if the darkness is real, light is much, much real. So tell us about the time when

749
00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:40.880
 the portal was opened. And you were taken into a portal. I was really actually looking for my friend

750
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:46.800
 like I wanted to understand what's going on. What did you give me? But guess what? She transferred

751
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:54.000
 from a different university. I was like, she's not there. You know, I'm like, oh, wow. Like,

752
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.080
 like, she just fulfilled whatever she needs to fulfill, you know. And so there's this one,

753
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:08.400
 there's this story. But this doesn't happen when I was in college. Somehow, I was graduated already,

754
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:15.600
 you know, like, I was actually like, started to know God. And I think the enemy is trying to

755
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:22.720
 prevent me to really give my loyalty to God's kingdom. So I always see some door, something

756
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:28.720
 like that. This is a door, Jennifer. And then it looks like a very ancient door. It's like an

757
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:35.280
 ancient door with it's hard to, it's like, it's like, it's like it's been there for so long. It's

758
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.320
 like it's exist. It's like ancient, ancient. I think that's the best way I can describe it.

759
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:50.640
 And so I was taken into this place where it, it is, it is in my human perception for our

760
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:56.320
 listener to kind of really imagine this. It looks like a warehouse, but it's a realm. Okay, when

761
00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:01.040
 it's like a warehouse, it looks like that. And then this woman, this little girl, she's little

762
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:07.280
 girl. Like what I said before, I often see them visiting, or I often see them, you know, talking

763
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:15.120
 like that, or, you know, showing things in the realm. But this one is different because the evil

764
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:23.440
 presence of that girl, she's not a girl, she's not an ordinary girl. She is full of, you know, like,

765
00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:31.120
 she learned so many cunning ways. That's how I can describe it. She's full of craftiness. I don't

766
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:38.720
 say wisdom, like crafty, like she's just pure evil. Like there's nothing good in her. Because

767
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:45.200
 when I look at her, she looked like she, she, she dressed up like an ancient little girl. Like

768
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.880
 she came from a past, from the past, past, past, like that kind of clothes is way back from the

769
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:59.120
 past. And then she, she's laughing. And I don't want to hear her laugh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, at that

770
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:04.960
 time, I was really, you know, just hearing her laugh is just, it's like, it's like, dragging

771
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.120
 you to hell. That's how I can describe that kind of laugh. It's like that. And so she's, she just,

772
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:17.040
 don't speak to me, but she just, just grabbed, like, just grabbed me and just, we go to this

773
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:23.040
 place. And as we were, you know, it's like this, it's like this, how can I, so I was sitting at

774
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:28.400
 that time, I was sitting, before we go to that part, I was sitting and then suddenly, I just saw

775
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:36.320
 her in front of me. And she just run, run, run forward. Like, she just run there. She just trying

776
00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:42.400
 to show me something. So I just looking at her, I was just looking at her. And then I now realized

777
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:47.520
 she dragged me and I was next to her. I was like, whoa, like, I was just seeing her running there.

778
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.720
 And now, you know, I was next to her. It's so, it's so scary that time getting first, so scared

779
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:59.680
 by the blood of Jesus. Lord, by the blood of Jesus Christ, Lord, I'm not saying this to entertain

780
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:06.080
 fear or to, you know, promote fear in the hearts of the listener. I was trying to, by the grace of

781
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:13.600
 God, to just expose, you know, the experience that is being kept in me for so long. And, you know,

782
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:19.120
 I always feel discouraged to always speak about this because of the fear of retaliation.

783
00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:26.560
 But this is the, the word that God gave me is 1 John 4, for greater is he that's living in me,

784
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:32.960
 that he that is in the world. And also Isaiah 54, verse 17, no weapon forms against me,

785
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:38.560
 shall prosper. I just need to say that, Jennifer, because the atmosphere I just sensed is something.

786
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:47.120
 So I need to continue by the blood of the lamb in the name of Jesus Christ. So while I was next to

787
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:55.360
 her, she said, look, she said to me, look, look, she's like a child, like playful, playful, evil

788
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.280
 child. That's how I can describe her. And, you know, Jennifer, she's not a child because

789
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:05.040
 she can shapeshift herself. I will just tell that later. So for now, she's a child. That's what she

790
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:10.080
 looks like. And then she told me, look, look like that. So I look, and I saw this man.

791
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.720
 She is doing her regular, you know, regular day of eating her, his meal, of eating his meal.

792
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:23.520
 And then she's like, laughing, like, hey, you know, like that, we put something in his food,

793
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:29.120
 and you don't know it like that is like, like the playful, evil thing that I know, like,

794
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:36.880
 this. And then he said, look what she's going to put in his mouth in the normal, regular day,

795
00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:44.080
 it looks like he's just eating, you know, like a normal burger, and a normal meat. But she said,

796
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:54.320
 watch, as soon as the guy put it in, in his mouth, it became a raw, rotten. I don't know why

797
00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:00.640
 it's hard to describe. It's very nasty, very nasty. It's like, it's like, this is how I can

798
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:08.560
 describe it as best as I can. It's like a meat that's been stuck for six months, you know, and

799
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:15.680
 it's, it looks, it doesn't look like a meat anymore. It looks so dark, and so gross, just

800
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:23.760
 nasty. And he's putting it in his mouth. And then as soon as this, this man eating it like a normal

801
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:31.440
 food, she laughed and laughed and laughed. And her laugh echoed from that room of that warehouse to

802
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:37.040
 all the four corners of that warehouse. That's why I said I could not, I do not want to hear that

803
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:43.760
 anymore. Because he's like, he's just like laughing, like, so evil. And then she said

804
00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:51.120
 that man didn't realize in just a moment, what people in in his food is about to kill him,

805
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:56.880
 you know, it's like, he's, he's gonna die. And when he said that, it's like, he's like saying,

806
00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:02.480
 like a play, you know, like a child play. He's gonna die like that. That's what he said.

807
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:08.240
 I was like, I couldn't even talk to him. I, you know, you know, this is how scary that girl is.

808
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:15.280
 I couldn't even look at her. Because the evil presence is so strong. I couldn't even look at

809
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:21.680
 her. It's like them, when they see an on fire Christian, when they see a spirit filled believer,

810
00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:28.640
 you are so bright, they couldn't even wanted to even look at you. That's why if we are lukewarm,

811
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:35.840
 that's where they get the entry, you know, to really do some damage. But, you know, when you

812
00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.640
 are a spirit filled believer, you're full of light. That's how you could that was in that realm.

813
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.360
 That's how dark she is. I couldn't look at her. Because it feels like if I look at her, I'm going

814
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:52.080
 to die. That's how evil you know, that's how the gravity of the evil presence that's in her and

815
00:57:52.080 --> 00:58:00.640
 the man keeps eating. And I was, I wanted to stop him doing it. I'm like, No, don't eat that. But I

816
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:08.000
 just couldn't because I feel like if I do something to him, this this girl next to me might, you know,

817
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:15.200
 do something harm to me. So it's bad. So I was just like, dumbfounded. But then, suddenly,

818
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:20.080
 he ran, she ran away again. She ran away. And she's just and every time she ran away,

819
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.360
 I'm going to be dragged to where she's going. So I saw her she ran, she ran again. And then suddenly,

820
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:34.400
 boom, we were in this place. And then she's mocking me. Because maybe she knows that

821
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:41.440
 somehow when I was a child, like I accepted Jesus. Somehow when I was a child, I know God.

822
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:48.880
 And so she's trying to put an illusion in me that I am in paradise. Okay, so before I started there,

823
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.720
 I heard a lot of near death experience. I was listening to those near death experience in

824
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.220
 YouTube.

825
00:58:55.220 --> 00:59:11.220
 Because somehow, when you have this kind of experience, I'm still on the point where I'm still studying, Jennifer, I'm still learning and doing a lot of research about what I experienced.

826
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:21.220
 So I'm listening and trying to ask the Holy Spirit and ask God if this near-death experience is from Him.

827
00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:28.220
 There are many ridiculous near-death experiences that I'm hearing a lot.

828
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:37.220
 That, okay, okay, go on, that kind of experience is not a real heaven, it is an illusion.

829
00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:49.220
 And I think that kind of entity, because she has that full power, she can manifest a place where it is a very illusion place.

830
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:54.220
 Because as soon as she ran, she brought me in this place that looked like a paradise.

831
00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.220
 She wanted me to believe that I am in heaven.

832
00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:03.220
 So we got out of that warehouse and there's that paradise.

833
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.220
 Jennifer, it's so beautiful.

834
01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:11.220
 There's flowers, the grass is so green, like very green.

835
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:20.220
 And there's also little children like her, they're playing and they're having fun of their life.

836
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.220
 And then she said, go on.

837
01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.220
 She said to me, go, go there, walk.

838
01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:33.220
 But something is odd about this place.

839
01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.220
 Something is odd.

840
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:39.220
 Heaven can only be heaven if the presence of God is there.

841
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.220
 And that's where you know that it is heaven.

842
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:53.220
 But for someone who never encountered God, who never had a relationship with Jesus Christ, and you never know the word of God, never have prayer in your life,

843
01:00:53.220 --> 01:01:05.220
 you have no idea that deception is so high that you will have no idea that it is not heaven, but it is an illusion paradise.

844
01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:15.220
 That's what, you know, because me, I think when she's trying to tell me to go on, she wanted me to trap in this place.

845
01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.220
 She wanted me to trap in there.

846
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:23.220
 And if I embrace the thing that, okay, I am in heaven, I'm doomed.

847
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:30.220
 She was going to trap me in there because I put my faith in the belief that that place is a paradise.

848
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:42.220
 But because this is how I kind of really try to really analyze this, how this evil girl will give me a paradise?

849
01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:46.220
 I mean, how will she able to bring me there?

850
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220
 She is no angel, you know?

851
01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:54.220
 And even though I have a little knowledge about the Bible when I was young, God sealed me.

852
01:01:54.220 --> 01:02:04.220
 When I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, I think that's what really kept me from discerning that it is a false paradise.

853
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.220
 There's also light in that place, Jennifer.

854
01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:12.220
 This is like a paradise where there is light, but the light there is different.

855
01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:16.220
 It's not compared to the light of God.

856
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.220
 It's different.

857
01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:22.220
 I don't know how she produced light, but if I see it, it's so dim.

858
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.220
 It's not like light, like it's just dim.

859
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:31.220
 I don't know where she come up with that, but the place looks like afternoon.

860
01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.220
 Afternoon in the paradise is what it looks like.

861
01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220
 It looks so gloomy.

862
01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:46.220
 And the more I look at the place, suddenly, while she keeps on convincing me to go in there, a place where they sit like a bench.

863
01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.220
 It looks like a bench or something like that.

864
01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:53.220
 It looks like a beautiful park, paradise field, flowers, everything.

865
01:02:53.220 --> 01:03:06.220
 But it's an illusion because as soon as you look at it intently, Jennifer, the longer you look at it, you see some odd in that place.

866
01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.220
 There is a shade of darkness.

867
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:15.220
 I'm like, if this is real paradise, there should not be any like this.

868
01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:18.220
 Yeah, so I run.

869
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:22.220
 As soon as I had the chance, I ran.

870
01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.220
 I ran.

871
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.220
 I ran and I ran.

872
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.220
 And I'm like, God help me.

873
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.220
 I'm trying to say it in my mind.

874
01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.220
 I couldn't escape.

875
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.220
 I'm trying to run.

876
01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.220
 And then I go back to the warehouse again.

877
01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.220
 And then when I ran, I go back to that paradise again.

878
01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.220
 But I really don't go inside.

879
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.220
 That's the thing.

880
01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:45.220
 Because I know if I go in, she will trap me.

881
01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.220
 I think that's what she's after.

882
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:54.220
 And so she said to me, OK, you call your God because that's where I don't know.

883
01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:58.220
 I think she heard my thought because I said, Jesus Christ, help me.

884
01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.220
 I'm just screaming.

885
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.220
 God, God, let me out.

886
01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.220
 But while I'm screaming, my mouth is not moving.

887
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.220
 It's like my thought is screaming.

888
01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:10.220
 It's like, let me out, Jesus Christ, let me out.

889
01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:15.220
 That's why I keep on saying I'm like screaming, wailing inside my thoughts.

890
01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:22.220
 And then she got mad at me and she said, OK, OK, that's not nice, she said to me.

891
01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.220
 That's not nice.

892
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.220
 Why are you calling your God?

893
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.220
 I don't want to.

894
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.220
 She's like a child.

895
01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.220
 I don't want this game anymore.

896
01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.220
 I don't want this game.

897
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.220
 That's not cool like that.

898
01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.220
 Why are you calling your God like that?

899
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:40.220
 And then suddenly there's a hole that's been opened to me.

900
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.220
 It's like in that room, there's like a hole that's been opened.

901
01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.220
 It's like there's that light.

902
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.220
 It's like a very like the light getting that hole.

903
01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:52.220
 So I burst in light and then suddenly it gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

904
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.220
 The light gets bigger.

905
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.220
 And I was stuck in that light.

906
01:04:55.220 --> 01:05:00.220
 And I was hearing her and she said to me, I'm not done with you.

907
01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.220
 I'm going to find you.

908
01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.220
 I'm going to kill you.

909
01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.220
 Like that.

910
01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:11.220
 Like, like, like, like the very, very bones of, you know, of this little evil girl.

911
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.220
 She hates me to the core.

912
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:18.220
 That's how I can describe how she hates me so much, you know.

913
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.220
 And then she's like, you're getting away like that.

914
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:26.220
 So she's she's just like, you know, like a child that lose a toy.

915
01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.220
 Like it's just like having tantrums like that.

916
01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:41.220
 When you have this kind of experience in the room, Jennifer, sometimes you feel like you're in a trance or sometimes you're in in a normal situation, environment, like you're in the classroom or you're in the house, but you couldn't function.

917
01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:53.220
 You couldn't function, because the memory of the trauma that's inflicted in you is so, so deep that sometimes I even lose myself to eat.

918
01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:58.220
 Or even I don't know the past, the time just passed and I just not being productive.

919
01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.220
 I just feel so depressed.

920
01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:06.220
 Depression is another spirit that's operating in the world, you know.

921
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:11.220
 And if you notice, it's getting, you know, really bigger and bigger and bigger.

922
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:18.220
 And so it's not something because you're sad or something, but sometimes, you know, this is influence of them.

923
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:23.220
 I was so depressed and sometimes, you know, they said to me, this one, she's a familiar spirit.

924
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.220
 She looks like my sister.

925
01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:33.220
 So she come to me like very nice and very, you know, like, like she said to me, you know, you can you can come here now.

926
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:39.220
 It is safe here because the world where you live in is the same as the world that where we are.

927
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:42.220
 It's just an illusion. Everything is an illusion.

928
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.220
 It doesn't matter where you are. It doesn't matter. OK, just come here.

929
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:48.220
 You know, so you have no problem.

930
01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:53.220
 You know, you have no struggle. You just live with us in peace.

931
01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:59.220
 Like actually, they don't use the word peace, but it's like you can live with us because this is real.

932
01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.220
 I think that's what they are using it like.

933
01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:09.220
 This is more real. And, you know, somehow I that's why I'm telling you, I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

934
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:17.220
 Once you experience to see another realm, another world, when you come back to Earth, when you come back to your normal life,

935
01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:21.220
 it feels like you had no you don't know what is the reality anymore.

936
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:26.220
 You don't know if this is the illusion or that world is the illusion.

937
01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:29.220
 You cannot identify what is real.

938
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.220
 That's the high, so high the deception is.

939
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.220
 You cannot identify what is really real.

940
01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:40.220
 So, yeah, so it's the grace of God kept me from that.

941
01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:49.220
 So, you know, let's go back to the false paradises and the NDE experiences that a lot of people are having,

942
01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:53.220
 because I personally believe that they're having these experiences.

943
01:07:53.220 --> 01:08:02.220
 But on the other hand, like what you were saying, it's not genuinely paradise is not genuinely heaven,

944
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:08.220
 but it is a false reality created by Satan in order like what you were and how the little girl was trying to trap you.

945
01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:16.220
 Go in, go in. Beautiful. The grass is green. And then you knew that if you were to go further, you would be trapped.

946
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:23.220
 Mm hmm. Yes. Have you noticed that a lot of these NDEs have been void of Jesus and God?

947
01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:27.220
 Exactly. Mm hmm. Exactly.

948
01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.220
 That's a very highlight of everything.

949
01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:34.220
 If the near death experience, you just go there.

950
01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:40.220
 Like what I said, illegal, illegal is like.

951
01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:46.220
 Because because this, Jennifer, actually in the Bible, in Corinthians, Paul mentioned this.

952
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:54.220
 OK, whether in the body, you know, he's not sure he's talking to the third person, but he's referring to himself.

953
01:08:54.220 --> 01:09:05.220
 Remember, so going to heaven or go or God give you a pass, you know, going to hell is like it should be legal.

954
01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:09.220
 It has that God's permission.

955
01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:17.220
 When I'm going to share later the angel visitation, why I said, you know, if it's God's permission is so different.

956
01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:23.220
 It's very different because when it is God's permission.

957
01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:34.220
 You you are going to be escorted by angel, but the highlights of the purpose of why they're doing it is because of Jesus Christ.

958
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:44.220
 When it is about something feels good, the feel good thing, something comfortable, something about yourself.

959
01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:48.220
 You need to relax to be calm in this place.

960
01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:50.220
 You have no worries. Everything is fine.

961
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.220
 You know. That is satanic.

962
01:09:54.220 --> 01:10:03.220
 That is really a trap because something that makes you feel about you.

963
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:13.220
 That's already a very concerning sign that it is not a genuine experience that's from God.

964
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:33.220
 There's a sign that is a false paradise that they're going to take you in the false paradise, especially if some random, you know, like what I said, this family, you know, like, oh, my sister or this random stranger is going to escort you in that place.

965
01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:41.220
 You know, and some random gods, you know, that say, hey, I'm this God glowing like that.

966
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:50.220
 But, you know, it's because, you know, Jennifer, if I if God didn't plant a seed in my heart, I will really believe it.

967
01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:55.220
 I was 12 years old. God already gave that, you know, that repentance.

968
01:10:55.220 --> 01:11:01.220
 I was just backslide. But in my backslide state, that's another thing I want to say.

969
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:04.220
 When you are in a backslidden state.

970
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.220
 That's where the enemy really they really want to kill you.

971
01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.220
 They really just want, you know, so that you cannot come back.

972
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.220
 You know, you cannot go back to God.

973
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:27.220
 And that's what they are trying to do to me all these years is to really, you know, drag me to kill me, you know, because I already know Jesus and they just don't want me to fully, you know, have a relationship with Jesus.

974
01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:33.220
 You know, that's I think that's why the portal, you know, is because I allow them.

975
01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:39.220
 And, you know, that's I repented to God because of that.

976
01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:48.220
 And so let's go back to what you said about that near-death experience, because this is how Satan works.

977
01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:57.220
 When it looks like the miracle or the near-death experience is like entertaining thing, just a pure entertainment.

978
01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:06.220
 That's not God, because when it is God's visitation, sometimes actually you don't want to see what God is going to show you.

979
01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:10.220
 But you somehow understand there's a truth in it.

980
01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:19.220
 And even though it's somehow, you know, something that is a warning, you feel the correction of love of God.

981
01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:28.220
 So when it is the near-death experience, you're always, always leading to Jesus Christ.

982
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.220
 John 46, I am the way, the truth and the life.

983
01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:35.220
 And no one comes through the Father except through me.

984
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.220
 There is only one specific address going to heaven.

985
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.220
 There's only one specific address going to heaven.

986
01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:43.220
 And it is that address.

987
01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:47.220
 The name of the address is Jesus Christ.

988
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:58.220
 Because if you have no legal entry to the spirit world and Jesus is not allowed it like what he did to Paul in his experience or to John in Patmos.

989
01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.220
 So you are in a very, very dangerous place.

990
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:08.220
 Because this is what also I learned in the realm.

991
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:19.220
 You know, Jennifer, not all people in the mental institution was just physically broken.

992
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.220
 Actually, some of their soul, this is deep.

993
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:29.220
 Some of their soul trapped somewhere in the other realm where they couldn't come back.

994
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:39.220
 Because why I say this, because I saw, like, remember I said to you, I grew up in a pagan background.

995
01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.220
 I saw my playmates.

996
01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:45.220
 I saw my playmates.

997
01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:51.220
 He always talks about this woman who's, you know, coming to him at night.

998
01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:59.220
 And he said, this woman is no ordinary. She's so beautiful. Like, very beautiful.

999
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:06.220
 This one is deep. So, somehow, every time, every night, he's going to the river.

1000
01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.220
 He's going to talk to that woman for hours and hours in that river.

1001
01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.220
 No one's seeing that woman.

1002
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:18.220
 So, the parents thought, okay, maybe he's getting crazy. We go to the mental hospital.

1003
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:25.220
 They brought him to the mental hospital. Well, the doctor there said, he's perfectly normal.

1004
01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:28.220
 He's perfectly fine. Nothing's wrong. Maybe he's just tired like that.

1005
01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:33.220
 But, you know, it progressed until such point.

1006
01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:38.220
 You know, that's another thing to look out when this is something to do with the spirit.

1007
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:43.220
 The doctor couldn't find anything wrong about you. That's another thing.

1008
01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:49.220
 Because I always see this. I always see this in my mission or ministry, you know, in Philippines.

1009
01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.220
 That the doctor couldn't find something.

1010
01:14:52.220 --> 01:15:01.220
 So, now, that man, he just said, this is the last time we remember he said, he's going to get married to that woman.

1011
01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:08.220
 After that, he is somewhere now where he's talking to someone constantly and looking at.

1012
01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:13.220
 And then, you know, he has a certain place where he's just so happy. He's very, very happy.

1013
01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:20.220
 Now, he's in our world. Like, he's functioning his physical body here, but he's not here.

1014
01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.220
 His mind is someplace else.

1015
01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:27.220
 Yeah, yeah. I mean, and this is the doctor telling, he's perfectly normal before.

1016
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:33.220
 But now, seeing him, he's not. And he's like digging, digging, digging.

1017
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:37.220
 He just digs something from the forest.

1018
01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:42.220
 Something. It's like something ridiculous that this woman is trying to manipulate this man.

1019
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:46.220
 And, yep, until his subconscious is not there.

1020
01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:50.220
 So, like what I said, that's very dangerous.

1021
01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:57.220
 Because you may come back, but you are somewhere out in the realm where your body is here, but your soul is trapped.

1022
01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.220
 Back to the NDEs, the near death.

1023
01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.220
 And then we'll move on a little bit now.

1024
01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:13.220
 So, are you saying that if someone sees their relatives, say a child that passed away or your mother or your grandmother or your husband that passed away,

1025
01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.220
 if you're dying and you see that, that's not God.

1026
01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:20.220
 But if you see angels or Jesus, then you know that's from the Lord.

1027
01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:34.220
 And also, I really wanted to encourage everyone to really get into the word of God, to pray, you know, worship, do this spiritual discipline.

1028
01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:39.220
 Because even though sometimes they said they are angel, you know.

1029
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.220
 Okay, so maybe I need to tell you this, Jennifer.

1030
01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.220
 So, did you know some demons are naked?

1031
01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.220
 Like they are naked. I don't know why they are naked.

1032
01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:52.220
 Anyway, so this one, he said, I am Jesus, like that, you know.

1033
01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:55.220
 And I'm like, no, you're not Jesus.

1034
01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:59.220
 This is like, you know, but that's another thing.

1035
01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:08.220
 Sometimes the level of your spiritual assignment is the level of the devil's spiritual assignment that they're going to give to you.

1036
01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:13.220
 Like before, it's like a little demon and then now it's like this deception of fake Jesus.

1037
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:17.220
 Okay, it's also all over the world now, this fake Jesus going on.

1038
01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.220
 Okay, I just wanted everyone to be aware of that.

1039
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:23.220
 So, I think it started this year.

1040
01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.220
 It's more kind of really going to be obvious this year.

1041
01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:32.220
 It's actually, if you kind of really go to Bible, because we need to be biblical.

1042
01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.220
 It's in Revelation.

1043
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.220
 I remember the four horsemen, you know.

1044
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:42.220
 And there's this white, the one that's running, who says, you know, his piece, you know.

1045
01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:47.220
 And three and a half years, you know, there's false peace that's going to reign, you know.

1046
01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.220
 So, he said, I'm Jesus.

1047
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.220
 I said, no, you're not Jesus.

1048
01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:58.220
 So, when I started to do this, by the blood of the Lamb of my Lord Jesus Christ, my Savior, my Protector, like that.

1049
01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.220
 Suddenly, he shifted.

1050
01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.220
 He suddenly changed.

1051
01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.220
 Like, he looks like a djinn.

1052
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.220
 You know, a djinn?

1053
01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.220
 A djinn? What do you mean by djinn?

1054
01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.220
 Like a genie.

1055
01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.220
 Like, he looks like a genie.

1056
01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.220
 Yeah, but he's three feet.

1057
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.220
 He's three feet.

1058
01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.220
 He has a very bulgy tummy and he's naked.

1059
01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:23.220
 And then his eyes, when he opened, is pure black.

1060
01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.220
 And he's very comical.

1061
01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:30.220
 Like, he's kind of really, you know, doing something crazy.

1062
01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:34.220
 And I'm like, also, I was so mad at him, you know.

1063
01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:39.220
 I'm like, so, this is where I'm after my prayer, you know.

1064
01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.220
 Because sometimes they attack you after you pray.

1065
01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.220
 So, this is prayer fasting, I think.

1066
01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.220
 Yeah, I remember when Jesus, you know, being tempted.

1067
01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:51.220
 So, when I was about to grab him, you know, I was so mad at him.

1068
01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.220
 I was about to grab him and he's suddenly gone.

1069
01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:58.220
 You know, he's afraid of the blood of Jesus Christ.

1070
01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.220
 Like what you said, Jennifer.

1071
01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:04.220
 We need to pay attention to, also, you know that you know that Jesus.

1072
01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.220
 There is no doubt when it is Jesus.

1073
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.220
 It is 100% you know it's Jesus.

1074
01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:16.220
 Because he's the only one who can bring that presence, the very pure presence of love.

1075
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.220
 That kind of pure kind of love.

1076
01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:24.220
 If you encounter that purity of that love, the highest form of peace.

1077
01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:28.220
 The highest form of peace is like something is like going around you.

1078
01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.220
 And they say, you know, like the world is going to end.

1079
01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.220
 You do not care.

1080
01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:34.220
 You just know that you're being held.

1081
01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.220
 That peace beyond human understanding.

1082
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.220
 That joy.

1083
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.220
 That is the presence of Jesus Christ.

1084
01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:46.220
 If somehow, someone, you know, your relatives or whoever going to drag you in their place.

1085
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.220
 And you had this doubt.

1086
01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.220
 You know, you have this, you know, like fear, you know.

1087
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.220
 You need to really pray.

1088
01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:59.220
 Because, you know, that's really something very concerning and dangerous.

1089
01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.220
 Yeah.

1090
01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.220
 Even the angel.

1091
01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:09.220
 Sometimes, you know, there was this like time that, you know, when the angel visited you.

1092
01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.220
 When it comes from the Lord.

1093
01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.220
 They also bring that kind of presence.

1094
01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:15.220
 Even though they look like a very serious type of angel.

1095
01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:19.220
 Because some angels really look like, okay, yeah.

1096
01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.220
 Like something you cannot mess up with.

1097
01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:24.220
 But, you know, it is the angel of God.

1098
01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:28.220
 Because they also had carried that light, that presence of God.

1099
01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.220
 But some angel that, you know, say angel like that.

1100
01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.220
 Sometimes you're kind of really, they're not.

1101
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.220
 Because sometimes they're just vile.

1102
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:39.220
 You know.

1103
01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:41.220
 And you will really know it.

1104
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:45.220
 Because they couldn't really kept the goodness.

1105
01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.220
 They just couldn't do it.

1106
01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.220
 They can act for a while.

1107
01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:56.220
 But they just going to blow their, you know, whatever they made up.

1108
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.220
 Yeah.

1109
01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.220
 So, yeah.

1110
01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:02.220
 I'm encouraged for everyone not to be deceived, you know.

1111
01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.220
 To really come to Jesus Christ.

1112
01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.220
 And to really read your Bible.

1113
01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.220
 Once again, really get into the word.

1114
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:10.220
 And the Holy Spirit, you know.

1115
01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:12.220
 Ask the Holy Spirit, you know.

1116
01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.220
 To really understand what the word of God is.

1117
01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.220
 Those are basic.

1118
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.220
 But Jennifer, those are really something, you know.

1119
01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:22.220
 That will going to lead us to not be deceived.

1120
01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:27.220
 Because nowadays, this is actually what's going on.

1121
01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:32.220
 Is there's a very, very fine line of truth.

1122
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.220
 You know.

1123
01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:37.220
 The deception nowadays is like a strand of hair.

1124
01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:40.220
 That's how dangerous we are living in right now.

1125
01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.220
 And they're working in any system in the world.

1126
01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:46.220
 Especially in the rich country.

1127
01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.220
 In the regional system.

1128
01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.220
 In government.

1129
01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.220
 In everywhere, you know.

1130
01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.220
 They're just that influence.

1131
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:55.220
 And you know why it's happening?

1132
01:21:55.220 --> 01:22:02.220
 Because America in the history was once a Biblical grounded society and nation.

1133
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.220
 They loved the word of God.

1134
01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:09.220
 And then suddenly America turned into embracing the Eastern religion.

1135
01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.220
 Embracing all kinds of, you know, belief.

1136
01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:18.220
 And in the Bible, when Israel commit idolatry.

1137
01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:22.220
 By turning away, setting up altars.

1138
01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:27.220
 This God or this entity, fallen angels and many things.

1139
01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.220
 They're being summoned.

1140
01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:33.220
 And nowadays, you know, everyone's starting to always build an altar.

1141
01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.220
 If you notice that.

1142
01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.220
 Building on altars.

1143
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.220
 Building on altars.

1144
01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.220
 Is summoning them.

1145
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:39.220
 You know.

1146
01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.220
 And, you know, like going to new age movement.

1147
01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.220
 You know, about the universe and everything.

1148
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.220
 So that is really summoning them to come back.

1149
01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.220
 And that is people telling that.

1150
01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:53.220
 They are refusing God.

1151
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.220
 And they're refusing Jesus Christ.

1152
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.220
 And if you notice the faith.

1153
01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:01.220
 Of the grateful always getting weaker and weaker in Christianity.

1154
01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:06.220
 Because we embrace again that different, you know, belief.

1155
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.220
 And it's very sad.

1156
01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.220
 And that's why I'm encouraging everyone, you know.

1157
01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.220
 Jesus Christ is the only specific address to heaven.

1158
01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.220
 In first Corinthians chapter 13.

1159
01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.220
 No matter how you discover the mysteries.

1160
01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:21.220
 You can speak the language of angels.

1161
01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:24.220
 You will know the deep knowledge of this world.

1162
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.220
 But if you do not have that love.

1163
01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.220
 We gain nothing.

1164
01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:32.220
 No matter how many amazing NDE we have.

1165
01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:35.220
 If we don't have that Jesus Christ.

1166
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.220
 The pure.

1167
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.220
 Highest form of love.

1168
01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.220
 In this world.

1169
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.220
 We gain nothing.

1170
01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:44.220
 That's what I can encourage everyone.

1171
01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.220
 Sandy Lynn.

1172
01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.220
 So you gave your life to Jesus when you were 12 years old.

1173
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:52.220
 But yet you had these demonic encounters.

1174
01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.220
 And there are some Christians who believe that once you become born

1175
01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.220
 again.

1176
01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.220
 These things can't happen to you.

1177
01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:01.220
 But why do you believe this happened to you?

1178
01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.220
 You giving your life to Jesus.

1179
01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:05.220
 Even when you were 12 years old.

1180
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:07.220
 Yes.

1181
01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.220
 Like what I said, Jennifer.

1182
01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.220
 I gave my life to Jesus Christ.

1183
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:16.220
 When I was 12.

1184
01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:19.220
 I thought I accept him as my Lord and savior.

1185
01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.220
 But I only accept him as my savior.

1186
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.220
 And not my Lord.

1187
01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.220
 Because for him to be the Lord of your life.

1188
01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:26.220
 Jesus said.

1189
01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.220
 If you love me.

1190
01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:32.220
 You obey my command.

1191
01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.220
 And that's where I don't have that in me.

1192
01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.220
 I am a Christian.

1193
01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.220
 Yes.

1194
01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.220
 I am still the master of myself.

1195
01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:41.220
 I'm still running my own show.

1196
01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.220
 And doing my own way.

1197
01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.220
 And becoming.

1198
01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.220
 Not only lukewarm.

1199
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:48.220
 But playing God.

1200
01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.220
 And think that God will always understand.

1201
01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.220
 Another thing I want to also.

1202
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.220
 Give importance is.

1203
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.220
 Since I was 12.

1204
01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.220
 I really don't have the deep root.

1205
01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:00.220
 And that's very important.

1206
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.220
 That biblical truth.

1207
01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.220
 That foundation of the word.

1208
01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.220
 That is the foundation of the word.

1209
01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:08.220
 Jesus Christ is the word.

1210
01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.220
 And for us to grow.

1211
01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:12.220
 In our faith.

1212
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.220
 We need to really.

1213
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:17.220
 Always have the word.

1214
01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.220
 The promises that we can.

1215
01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.220
 We can really keep in our hearts.

1216
01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.220
 And the word as the sword of the spirit.

1217
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.220
 It is our weapon.

1218
01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.220
 In our daily life.

1219
01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:32.220
 This earth is a constant battle.

1220
01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:35.220
 And I know.

1221
01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:38.220
 During the time.

1222
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.220
 They got tired of fighting.

1223
01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:43.220
 Sometimes in our life.

1224
01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.220
 Jennifer.

1225
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.220
 What I experienced.

1226
01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.220
 I just got tired of fighting.

1227
01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:52.220
 I just got tired of believing.

1228
01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.220
 That God is real.

1229
01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:57.220
 And God will do something about my life.

1230
01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:00.220
 I just keep on doing my own way.

1231
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:02.220
 And back when I was college.

1232
01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:04.220
 I just don't think.

1233
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.220
 Jesus, you're not so cool.

1234
01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:08.220
 For my season now.

1235
01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:10.220
 I just try to keep you.

1236
01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.220
 For now.

1237
01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:15.220
 And just looking back at that.

1238
01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:18.220
 I just really feel.

1239
01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:20.220
 Jesus, if I only really take seriously.

1240
01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.220
 Of my faith.

1241
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.220
 I hold on to my faith.

1242
01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.220
 I can do more for your kingdom.

1243
01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.220
 But it's never been too late.

1244
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.220
 And I just want to say.

1245
01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:32.220
 To you.

1246
01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.220
 As soon as you come back to him.

1247
01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.220
 And repent.

1248
01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.220
 Like what I said.

1249
01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:42.220
 I came from a pagan background.

1250
01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:45.220
 Grace is very unfamiliar to us.

1251
01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.220
 For us to be validated.

1252
01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:49.220
 There is always a sacrifice.

1253
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.220
 Being a Christian is amazing.

1254
01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:55.220
 Because God did all the sacrifice.

1255
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.220
 2000 years ago on the cross.

1256
01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.220
 He gave me that submission.

1257
01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.220
 Surrender.

1258
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.220
 And obedience to his will.

1259
01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:06.220
 Now I am a beautiful masterpiece of God.

1260
01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.220
 And my journey is not yet.

1261
01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.220
 Really there.

1262
01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.220
 But God teaching me.

1263
01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.220
 How to walk in.

1264
01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:17.220
 Really accepting him now.

1265
01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.220
 As my Lord and Savior.

1266
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.220
 So Sandy Lynn.

1267
01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.220
 Take us to the time when you were escorted.

1268
01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.220
 To heaven.

1269
01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.220
 What did you see?

1270
01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.220
 You saw weapons.

1271
01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:31.220
 But these weapons were not metaphorical.

1272
01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.220
 Yes.

1273
01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.220
 I am very excited.

1274
01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.220
 Because this one.

1275
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.220
 Just happened last year.

1276
01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.220
 Every year.

1277
01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.220
 I am doing.

1278
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.220
 Yielding to God.

1279
01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:47.220
 And to the Holy Spirit.

1280
01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.220
 Is a key.

1281
01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.220
 To really understand.

1282
01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:53.220
 God.

1283
01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:56.220
 In the book of Isaiah.

1284
01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:59.220
 Jeremiah chapter 3.

1285
01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.220
 It says, call unto me.

1286
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.220
 I will answer you.

1287
01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:05.220
 And tell you great things.

1288
01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:06.220
 That you do not know.

1289
01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.220
 I hold on to that.

1290
01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.220
 If I keep on coming to God.

1291
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.220
 God will show me.

1292
01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.220
 That year.

1293
01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.220
 I am expecting something wonderful.

1294
01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:19.220
 God what is this year for us?

1295
01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:21.220
 That is my question.

1296
01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:24.220
 This is not an ordinary dream.

1297
01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.220
 This is something special.

1298
01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:29.220
 I thought.

1299
01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.220
 I will keep this a secret.

1300
01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:35.220
 Sometimes Jennifer.

1301
01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:37.220
 Sometimes God said.

1302
01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:39.220
 Do not say this.

1303
01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:40.220
 This is yours.

1304
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:47.820
 to keep and let the time pass until it you know you see it will you know come true but this one is

1305
01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:55.420
 okay you need to tell this because this is not only for you but uh for the forerunners of faith

1306
01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:03.740
 and then god emphasized to me first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 to 26 if I remember it right

1307
01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:10.060
 about the forerunners so I'm going to emphasize this story about the race so

1308
01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:17.020
 in my dream um Jennifer um I saw this angel I actually getting familiar with them because

1309
01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:22.780
 every time every year if God is going to do something on that year or I need to pray to

1310
01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:29.260
 a certain place a certain people or church God is going to show it to me or I will have a very

1311
01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:35.580
 special angel visitation like what I said it is something that not your entertainment is something

1312
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:42.460
 that always work with advancing of God's kingdom and his purpose you know glory to Jesus Christ

1313
01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:51.580
 so um they said uh I'm here like that as soon as they said that I was transported and I saw this

1314
01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:58.140
 four angels I didn't forget them they have no wings by the way but they look so pure

1315
01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:04.060
 kind and meek but there's something that the authority I think that's that's the word I

1316
01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:09.500
 can the authority that they have you know is like that kind of angel you do not want to mess up in

1317
01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:14.860
 that place I feel like a child like a very excited child because this is the way that they said to me

1318
01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:22.380
 um you are in the training that's what the word they said to me I mean how many training you know

1319
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.740
 because they I think this is the third or the fourth time I heard they always say that and

1320
01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:34.460
 you're in the training like that so I said okay I'm in the training and as I look I

1321
01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:40.540
 pay attention to the angel but now I was just mesmerized with where I am you know I was like

1322
01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:46.460
 I was like you know like inside me I'm like like I'm jumping for joy I was just so excited I know

1323
01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:55.900
 what is this and I saw the room I saw different swords and that any single one of them is the same

1324
01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:04.540
 they are so unique design in many ways and there's one thing um I want you to know about certain

1325
01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:13.260
 things there in the the room or in heaven as a general like here on earth when we use a spoon

1326
01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:19.820
 or you know any non-living things they are non-living they're really not breathing or anything

1327
01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:25.580
 but in in heaven you know like when I was I remember when I was a child like saw that vision

1328
01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:31.340
 you know like everything there is alive it's like it's like the tree the flowers it's like

1329
01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:39.900
 everything is alive and all my years of being a missionary and all my years of walking with

1330
01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:49.260
 Jesus Christ I always encounter Ephesians 6 about the armor of God so I thought that the sword of

1331
01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:55.660
 the spirit is a metaphor you know because it's something that that you learn like you know belt

1332
01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:01.020
 of truth you know of course to protect you from truth so you will have confidence and gospel of

1333
01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:06.860
 shoes you know helmet salvation breastplate of freshness the shield of faith and the sword of

1334
01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:11.900
 the spirit so the sword of the spirit I thought this is all metaphors everything there's a

1335
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:20.700
 metaphors like that but the angel explained to me that all the children of God all the child of God

1336
01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:29.180
 they really have a very special sword designed for them I was so amazed because I was like

1337
01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:36.780
 I never knew God I never knew this is real that something that you really have it in

1338
01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:45.180
 spiritual battle like I was wow and so when I saw them they're not like in the shelves or

1339
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:53.180
 just like hanging on the shelves it's not that they're like alive they are so bright and they're

1340
01:32:53.180 --> 01:33:00.220
 like floating it's like like the room is like it's like it's like they are they are alive how can I

1341
01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:05.980
 explain that like they're they're at joy there's joy in that sword it's like you kind of see they

1342
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:13.500
 have a personality it's just amazing how I can describe it but you know when you have that you

1343
01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:20.780
 know experience you know be taken there it's such a privilege because you have that inner

1344
01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:27.180
 knowing you have that inner knowing to describe it because I think is God allowed that inner

1345
01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:33.900
 knowing for you so that you can send the message to describe what it looks really what that you

1346
01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:41.980
 see you know to be a witness what it really looks like so I saw this sword and I was so excited and

1347
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:50.460
 then the angel said today we are going to give you a new sword and my joy got so double and I was

1348
01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:56.940
 like like like you know like in my human you know in my human joy I was jumping for joy but but I'm

1349
01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:03.740
 not acting that way there because like what I said I tried to be proper you know facing this angel

1350
01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:09.740
 but inside me I'm like yes like that but then this is what he said

1351
01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:18.300
 but you need to pass the test I was like oh I'm like oh okay so then um they said to me um

1352
01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:24.460
 what's in your hand and you know what I never knew I never knew I'd be I've been holding that

1353
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:30.620
 for so long I never knew I have that sword all all along so when the angel asked me what's in

1354
01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:39.100
 your hand I suddenly I just saw I'm holding a sword but this sword that I have it is so small

1355
01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:47.740
 it's like this it's like most almost like a dagger actually this is so small and and it has that chip

1356
01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:55.980
 you know like it's crook it's crooked it's not really you know nice sword anymore you see that

1357
01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:02.540
 it's been to so much battle it's gone to so much battle that what it looks very worn out and so

1358
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:09.820
 they said in exchange for that you will have a new sword but you need to pass the test they um

1359
01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:17.100
 this angel repeated that to me so I'm like um I don't know if I say okay or what I responded

1360
01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:23.820
 but because everything is so fast Jennifer um and then they asked me to sit down and then

1361
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:31.580
 they gave me this it looked like a diamond crystal it's it's pure clear you know crystal

1362
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:40.940
 and they put it somewhere in me and now I understand that being an intercessor is the knee

1363
01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:47.660
 in the body of Christ because like you know I don't know that's a spiritual symbol because

1364
01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:54.460
 that's where they put that thing inside my knee but it's not uh operation that's painful it's

1365
01:35:54.460 --> 01:36:00.300
 just something that they just like they just like open it and just put it in there but it's so so

1366
01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:07.580
 neat and it's very they're very meticulous I think like the best you know surgeon it's like you never

1367
01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:14.700
 feel any pain any single pain so they just put it there and then I was reminded that being an

1368
01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:22.300
 intercessor that's the knee you know the body of Christ because Jesus is the head and so they said

1369
01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:31.580
 we are putting this so in times you need help in this test we can come to the rescue as fast

1370
01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:38.060
 you know as you know we can something like that and so as soon as they said that to me

1371
01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:45.820
 I didn't even process anything that's going on I was like uh some like you know yeah just a newbie

1372
01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:51.260
 like a newbie in this something like that so so I was like okay so what is this test that they're

1373
01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:57.980
 thinking I never even had a chance to even ask because in the blink of an eye we were in a place

1374
01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:06.140
 where there's these two roads two roads this is not in heaven so these two roads and then in that

1375
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:16.620
 two roads suddenly the shadow and smoke turn into two humanoids one is man one is woman I can say

1376
01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:22.140
 definitely they are demons but they are in human shape and so they're they're looking at each other

1377
01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:29.420
 like a very you know like very fierce and like smiling evil at each other it's like telling

1378
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:34.460
 each other like you know we're gonna make this this something like that you know like they're

1379
01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:42.700
 planning something bad something like that so the angel said you are going to run a race with these

1380
01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:51.180
 two creatures and when you run a race you need to win or else they will get your reward that's how

1381
01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:59.740
 the angel said I was like oh I was even I even never had a chance to ask what is the reward

1382
01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:05.500
 and the race it just started you know here at least here on earth they count one two three

1383
01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:13.580
 you know there's nothing like that there it's a very different kind of race in that that place

1384
01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:19.420
 so as soon as the angel said that you need to win so they will not get your reward as soon as he said

1385
01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:28.540
 that I became a light I just saw I'm a light and in that place when we run we don't use feet it's

1386
01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:35.580
 like we're a light and these two are like shadow shifting shadow something like that and so I can

1387
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:40.780
 say I'm so fast because and I can say I'm a light because again for my vision while I'm running is

1388
01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:48.060
 zooming in zooming out zooming in zooming out like it's so fast it's like an I'm a wind that

1389
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:57.180
 is like carrying light something like that and that road feels like I don't know it's so long

1390
01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:05.180
 because there is no um there's no time in that realm there is no um element of time so I cannot

1391
01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:13.660
 say it takes seven days or one hour I cannot say that but what I say is we ran and ran and ran and

1392
01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:18.060
 we never use our feet but I was that light and zooming in zooming out zooming in zooming out

1393
01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:27.420
 in that place and then what's amazing about that is by the grace of Jesus Christ I won

1394
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:32.380
 I didn't even realize I won I didn't even just I just realized that I won because

1395
01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:38.620
 we come back to the very place where we were which is the two crossroads and the angel next

1396
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:47.980
 to me said you won and then I saw it's like interesting huh like is that you won you get

1397
01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:53.260
 the reward after the angel said that I saw the reward in my hand it's like every time they speak

1398
01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:59.340
 that's where it manifests it's something like that it's like huh interesting so when as soon

1399
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:06.380
 as the angel said that I saw this a jug it's like it looked like a jug it's like a a potter

1400
01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:13.340
 it looks like a pot it's like a potter looking like jug and I'm holding it and it's like it has

1401
01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:19.980
 an oil inside that's how I can describe it it's like beautiful you know something inside I can't

1402
01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:25.420
 even tell what's inside even though I know it's a jug because in our world when you say you have

1403
01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:29.660
 a jug you kind of really guess what's inside right but there's an inner knowing that I know

1404
01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:37.420
 it's some kind of oil that I'm holding so while I'm holding this this is my reaction this is where

1405
01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:46.140
 why I'm feeling this I feel the heaviness as soon as I hold that oil I bend my knee I knelt down

1406
01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:51.980
 and I surrendered to the angel I gave the oil to the angel and I had just that inner knowing

1407
01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:59.340
 that when I won this race and I had that reward there's a bigger battle that I'm that is about

1408
01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:07.660
 for me to face because why are they going to give me sword like a new sword it means it is a new

1409
01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:17.020
 heights a new level of battle and I feel like god I don't know if I'm ready for this but let

1410
01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:26.220
 sure will be that but this just you know what's in my mind so as soon as I knelt down when I

1411
01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:34.620
 opened my eyes I'm in the artillery room again and then you know that place really gives you that

1412
01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:40.620
 relief like suddenly like I was I feel heavy and sad like you know like what will happen to me this

1413
01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:50.140
 is another level like that but when I um when I come back to the artillery I feel like you know

1414
01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:56.700
 like uh regenerated I feel that that excitement again the joy it comes back and then and then I

1415
01:41:56.700 --> 01:42:04.220
 was so excited and they say now you will have your new sword and you know it's like a gift like

1416
01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:09.260
 uh a hundred times better than Christmas opening gift that's that's how I can describe it's like

1417
01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:16.460
 I'm so excited and there's this as soon as the angel said that the four swords is like they

1418
01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:22.620
 came to me they're like you know soaring like floating so they came to me and stand in front

1419
01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:28.940
 of me they're so bright and they're so you know like what I said like they're moving they have

1420
01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.420
 personality you know it's like it's like they're kind of telling me like hey take me take me

1421
01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:40.220
 something like that so there's that two four swords that um you know like in front of me

1422
01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:47.500
 and um I thank God for letting me um kept the memory like um God retained the memory of what

1423
01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:55.260
 they look like so um may the Holy Spirit um help me to describe the detail of it so the first sword

1424
01:42:55.260 --> 01:43:03.420
 that I saw Jennifer um it it looks like uh the color is like ivory it's like milk but I'm not

1425
01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:08.780
 sure what kind of material is that but this is like an ivory sword like that it's just white

1426
01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:15.740
 milky looking bright sword and it's is in the handle it's like made of pure

1427
01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:23.500
 gold and has that you know like that gold that's kind of really arranged neatly you know that's

1428
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:30.780
 kind of really um you know twist nicely you know that that's that's the first sword it's so

1429
01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:38.620
 beautiful it's just beautiful and then the other one it looks like green emerald that's how I can

1430
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:46.220
 describe it it's like green emerald and it has that inscription it's like a language but this

1431
01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:51.500
 one I really don't understand what's that it's like that language I don't know because it's like

1432
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:59.820
 a symbol it's just a symbol it's like a different language and and um um it's also look beautiful

1433
01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:05.260
 and the way when I say beautiful it's like different level of beauty like this one looks

1434
01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:11.740
 like you know like um elegant like like like refined something like that you know and and

1435
01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:17.740
 this one this green emerald it looks like um like a deep ocean it's like it's like um

1436
01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:23.500
 it's just captivating it's like shimmery you know it's like when the ocean is shining when

1437
01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:30.220
 it's being heated by a sun something like that it's just beautiful you know and then the third one

1438
01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:39.340
 this one is like really really get my attention because that one is pure crystal glass it looks

1439
01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:45.180
 like diamond I'm not sure if it's like it's like pure crystal glass diamond like like the purity

1440
01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:50.060
 of that you can really see you know the see-through because it's so clear it's so beautiful

1441
01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:57.340
 and it has embedded different jewels different gems different stones and and the stone really

1442
01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:03.820
 really complement what that diamond sword look like it's so beautiful I'm like wow you're so

1443
01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:08.220
 beautiful I'm like you know like I'm talking to the sword it's you know it sounds crazy but I'm

1444
01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:15.340
 talking to this swords like that that's how I can describe it and then the last one um this one it

1445
01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:22.620
 looks um it's not really earthly material but it looks so okay so this is how I can describe it you

1446
01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:29.580
 know when you see a mountain in the land the grass and the mountain like like that kind of

1447
01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:35.660
 beauty you know when you see the field of land mountain grass that kind of beauty like we

1448
01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:41.820
 appreciate that so that's what it looks like but it looks like um a material like a leather

1449
01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:49.100
 like a leather in our earth but it weaves the weaving is the detail of how it weaves

1450
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:54.700
 it tells a story like it's not just you know randomly weaves just because it means like every

1451
01:45:54.700 --> 01:46:01.820
 part of the weaves tells a story and it has a very specific symbol why like god never creates

1452
01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:08.060
 something that doesn't have any purpose he is the god of detail he's just a god of detail he just

1453
01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:15.340
 so detailed in this very very perfect like it's just amazing that's the beauty of this one

1454
01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:20.780
 and so you know while they were standing and one thing I also noticed about them they are so bright

1455
01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:29.500
 like like shiny shiny bright like you know like um it's just it's just hard to explain the

1456
01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:34.940
 brightness where it's so bright but at the same time you can really look at it that kind of you

1457
01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:40.300
 know you know that brightness isn't like it didn't hurt your eyes and you know one thing that um I

1458
01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:47.980
 noticed about this sword when I go into differentiate it to the sword here on earth

1459
01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:54.140
 the sword here on earth when you know it's a sword when you hold it you know it's a weapon

1460
01:46:54.140 --> 01:47:04.700
 for killing it's a weapon to slash or to draw on you know aim you know like that but the sword

1461
01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:13.980
 that I saw is alive so it doesn't look really for you for maybe because if you're a child of god

1462
01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:23.100
 um it doesn't look scary or harmful it just looks so gentle it's like a friend this I can say it's

1463
01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:29.100
 like a sword a friend something like like like like like a like a sword that you want in your

1464
01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:33.580
 journey that you will never get bored of having because it's like something that you know that

1465
01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:39.420
 so gentle the sword that is so gentle so joyful because they have different personality because

1466
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:46.220
 they look so joyful they look so you know like like pull up spark sort of bursting you know

1467
01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:52.540
 goodness in them so that's the kind of sword that that these four four swords look like and so when

1468
01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:59.500
 I about to choose it Jennifer when I was about to get it I woke up but but the angel they're so

1469
01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:05.660
 gentle they they brought me gently in my body because I see a glimpse every time they they go

1470
01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:11.260
 sometimes you know I had the chance to when I open my eyes I see a glimpse of light when they

1471
01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:18.540
 you know so I see the glimpse when they put me back to my room and I woke up like I'm holding

1472
01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:26.060
 something and I was like and I was like like like you know like I got it I'm just sorry to spoil

1473
01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:34.540
 you though they didn't tell me what did I what did I choose that's I'm like even me it's like

1474
01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:41.580
 they kept this as a mystery to me but what I can assure of is I have it because as soon as I wake

1475
01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:48.060
 up I'm like a child I get up and I'm like you know like like I'm trying to yes I have it like

1476
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:55.420
 like you know that you know that you have it and then I was so excited and um I'm going to confess

1477
01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:59.980
 this to you Jennifer when I read the Bible there are part in the Bible that I'm really not so

1478
01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:08.700
 interested like the bloodline like the names you know but as soon as I get this there's that deep

1479
01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:14.860
 deep hunger for the word of God that when I read the bloodline I'm like wow tell me about it I'm

1480
01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:23.100
 doing a lot of research about you know um who who is um this person like that like the bloodline of

1481
01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:28.940
 Jesus Christ like what I said in the Bachu chapter 1 like the 14th generation from Abraham to David

1482
01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:37.260
 David to um captivity in Babylon and Babylon going to um Jesus generation and then you know I'm like

1483
01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:45.660
 oh wow I never see this you know like how you know Jennifer now I realize that if God puts

1484
01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:51.900
 something in there whether it looks boring you know for for someone like that names or blood like

1485
01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:58.220
 God put in there for a purpose God really put in there for a purpose and and that opens me up

1486
01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:04.300
 to so many things that I never see it before it's like a mystery so when I open the word of God

1487
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:08.780
 and that's why I understand okay so that's why it is the sword of the spirit it's something that

1488
01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:15.020
 has going to have a purpose in me and now I'm sharing the message during Bible study

1489
01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:21.420
 and the Holy Spirit you know it's like this person will tell me you know that's exactly pierced my

1490
01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:28.700
 heart like that's exactly the word I need I'm like Holy Spirit like God this is you yeah that's what

1491
01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:36.380
 they said to me this is God you know like you just just don't say it randomly it's like you

1492
01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:41.020
 don't know what I'm going through but what you say that's exactly what I need and it's like

1493
01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:47.340
 sometimes it became a healing that that word of God and sometimes you know it's just now I'm like

1494
01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:52.940
 um God who am I going to minister today and God will just exactly give me the right word and I'm

1495
01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:57.980
 like that's amazing I mean it's not just you know I just will take in there saying this

1496
01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:04.780
 it also has a purpose in my daily life and with ministering to others now when and I see the

1497
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:12.060
 people it's different it's like God gave me a very glimpse of how he feels when I look at the

1498
01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:20.940
 people I saw they are lost sick or dying I just always have that pain in me that I just go silently

1499
01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:26.060
 or secretly somewhere and pray for that person I was just if I'm not going to pray for that person

1500
01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:33.020
 or that church or whatever it's that community God will not making me sleep so I need to I kind of

1501
01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:39.740
 see you know God really loves not not only Jennifer not only the child of God not only the Christian

1502
01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:46.860
 he also loves the lost he's been searching for them and the Holy Spirit really is working hard

1503
01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:54.220
 um in our generation because this is the grace period of God and there will come a time that it

1504
01:51:54.220 --> 01:52:03.660
 will run out and so the passion and the compassion for the loss that's the happiness I feel right now

1505
01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:09.420
 when I look at that person I feel like I want to embrace that person I just like feel like I just

1506
01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:16.140
 want to pray for for that person and that kind of you know feeling you know that love so deep

1507
01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:20.620
 I never experienced that before with my walk because like what I said I'm a missionary

1508
01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:24.540
 I was a missionary for many years I've taken care of many you know children

1509
01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:30.140
 this kind of love is different and now that this year that is the calling of God

1510
01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:36.780
 and this is another thing Jennifer God said share this because this is not for you this is not for

1511
01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:43.020
 you alone this is for all the um the children of God that they need to pick up their sword

1512
01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:47.260
 again I'm going to emphasize that child of God you need to pick up your sword

1513
01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:54.700
 because the world right now you know we need God needs you know I'm you know it's like a call to

1514
01:52:54.700 --> 01:53:01.420
 arms Jennifer like it's a battle in first Corinthians chapter 9 verse you know 24 to 26 like

1515
01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:07.260
 um you are the forerunner of faith you are the forerunner of God and you need to win this race

1516
01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:13.980
 the Holy Spirit will enable you to win and this is where I'm going to end up this I know many of

1517
01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:20.700
 us always hear this quote you are so heavenly minded that you have no earthly use have you

1518
01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:27.100
 heard that but the calling right now that you're no earthly good right yeah yeah yeah yes that one

1519
01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:33.420
 but the calling of God right now Jennifer is you have to be heavenly minded because right now

1520
01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:40.060
 Christian became so earthly minded that they have no use you know for the heaven

1521
01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:46.380
 kingdom of God or the purpose of God and that's just grieving God just grieve his heart that's

1522
01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:53.020
 how I always feel seeing someone you know grieving God's heart that we can many Christian nowadays

1523
01:53:53.020 --> 01:54:00.700
 especially with the prosperity gospel going on we focus so much in heaven earthly things and

1524
01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:06.700
 we are so distracted and that's another enemy that Christian is facing right now is so distracted

1525
01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:12.860
 with so much things we need to really just focus in one thing just you know even an hour or just

1526
01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:18.940
 a minute of your time every day to God so the sword when you talk about the sword is that

1527
01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:24.380
 sword for everyone because you said that we're coming into that time is that sword for everyone

1528
01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:30.780
 yes is that called for such a time as this yes Jennifer you are that's a beautiful question

1529
01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:39.180
 you say because I'm going back to Joel chapter two when God's the Holy Spirit says is upon all

1530
01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:44.860
 flesh the Spirit of the Lord you know will be upon all flesh it means all flesh it means like

1531
01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:52.380
 God never you know like setting any you know a favoritism because you know God is

1532
01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:58.220
 a no respecter of man but at the same time the Holy Spirit is available you know the sword

1533
01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:03.820
 of the Spirit is available to you know to whoever call in the name of the Lord like

1534
01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:08.620
 because like repentance actually is going to really open a door for you you know to accept

1535
01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:15.100
 Jesus and you be in his kingdom and be a child of God and so this is you know available for everyone

1536
01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:22.860
 although Jennifer I would like to give a warning when you have a sword

1537
01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:31.180
 it is a responsibility it's like taking a vow in the kingdom of God you know that you have

1538
01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:39.260
 a responsibility you know to pray for someone or you know a Christian a child of God responsibility

1539
01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:46.220
 what once you hold that sword and you know sadly sadly nowadays um some people they use

1540
01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:54.220
 their sword to slash other other each other brethren brothers you know the sisters of

1541
01:55:54.220 --> 01:56:02.220
 Christ but um God that's that's the you know the calling of God is amen so tell us about the time

1542
01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:10.460
 now you've given your life to Jesus you've um survived everything that you've survived after

1543
01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:16.940
 college and all the spiritual warfare of course we're still battling this but you got to reconcile

1544
01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:24.540
 with your father quickly tell us about that okay thank you Jennifer um so 17 at that age like what

1545
01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:32.940
 I said um now that's the first time I met my dad and also um I didn't realize he's a pastor

1546
01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:39.580
 because like what I said before he's a drug addict all his life and now he's a pastor and so when I

1547
01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:48.300
 reconcile with him um it is where God um I ran away from home for three years God my first ministry

1548
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:55.900
 is mopping you know the floor of the church until God teach me um seeking him for that three years

1549
01:56:55.900 --> 01:57:01.500
 and this is the best important ministry that God teach me in that place forgiveness and that

1550
01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:09.740
 forgiveness is where you know I saw my dad um in that small house and his preaching and then after

1551
01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:16.460
 that I I embraced him and I said I'm sorry dad and you know something about happened you know after

1552
01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:24.940
 the forgiveness you know has been open to to both of us um something amazing happened to me

1553
01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:30.620
 that's where I became a missionary which is maybe a different story next time and also I

1554
01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:38.060
 got to reconcile with my mom when you know she went back to Philippines and even the abusers

1555
01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:45.180
 is like God really like that forgiveness it's a supernatural thing Jennifer it's not something

1556
01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:49.980
 you know that's just in you it's the Holy Spirit the supernatural forgiveness for all that

1557
01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:53.260
 those years because somehow the image of my father

1558
01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:55.260
 is like the image of God in me.

1559
01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:57.260
 Like I'm always asking, where were you

1560
01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:59.260
 when I was abused, when I was

1561
01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:01.260
 in pain, when I was being

1562
01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:03.260
 tortured, where were you? And that's my

1563
01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:05.260
 question with God. Maybe

1564
01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:07.260
 in the other story, I'm going to tell that

1565
01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:09.260
 but this time

1566
01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:11.260
 I wanted to end it that

1567
01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:13.260
 God

1568
01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:15.260
 really showed me, you know

1569
01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.260
 the miracle power of forgiveness

1570
01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:19.260
 and how before

1571
01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:21.260
 my dad died, 2016 when he

1572
01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:23.260
 died, that's where

1573
01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:25.260
 we got to reconcile, we got

1574
01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:27.260
 forgiveness and

1575
01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:29.260
 right now, Jennifer

1576
01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:31.260
 established five churches in Philippines

1577
01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:33.260
 two I got visit and

1578
01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:35.260
 they helped me in the

1579
01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:37.260
 ministry, you know.

1580
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.260
 Some of them really active in

1581
01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.260
 helping me with the mission

1582
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:43.260
 and the seeds that my

1583
01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:45.260
 dad planted, you know

1584
01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:47.260
 it's growing. He died but he

1585
01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:49.260
 left a legacy of

1586
01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.260
 Jesus Christ in the hearts of many

1587
01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:53.260
 homeless, drug recovery

1588
01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:55.260
 people.

1589
01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:57.260
 It's just a very amazing

1590
01:58:57.260 --> 01:58:59.260
 story that I really wanted to

1591
01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:01.260
 share. Is that something that I

1592
01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:03.260
 need or something I can say, I brag

1593
01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:05.260
 about, I work hard for this. All

1594
01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:07.260
 of my days of my life

1595
01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.260
 is only by the grace of

1596
01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:11.260
 God and that's how God made it

1597
01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:13.260
 clear to me that I will live

1598
01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:15.260
 under his grace because I am the

1599
01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:17.260
 monument of God's grace

1600
01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:19.260
 and this is how I wanted to end this.

1601
01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:21.260
 Amen. Sandy, Lynn

1602
01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.260
 and you wrote a book

1603
01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:25.260
 about your life. It's called Before

1604
01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:27.260
 Eternity. Could you quickly tell us about that?

1605
01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.260
 Yes, Before

1606
01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:31.260
 Eternity and then there's a

1607
01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:33.260
 subtitle, The One Who Dwells

1608
01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:35.260
 in Zion and this is

1609
01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:37.260
 a story about a

1610
01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:39.260
 woman who's been in a Christian

1611
01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:41.260
 journey. It's an adventure

1612
01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:43.260
 filled book, post-apocalyptic

1613
01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:45.260
 something to do, you know, with what

1614
01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:47.260
 happened, you know, to the earth and

1615
01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:49.260
 also the journey

1616
01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.260
 going from the very, very

1617
01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:53.260
 dark to coming to

1618
01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:55.260
 light and coming to the cross

1619
01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.260
 to Jesus Christ and going

1620
01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:59.260
 back to your first love. Sandy, Lynn, could you

1621
01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:01.260
 end this out in prayer? Could you pray

1622
02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.260
 for everyone watching right now who have

1623
02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:05.260
 been through, even

1624
02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:07.260
 been through, I guess, what you've

1625
02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:09.260
 been through, if not worse or

1626
02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:11.260
 even better, you know, but could you

1627
02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:13.260
 just pray for them in their walk with

1628
02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:15.260
 Jesus and that they'll learn

1629
02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:17.260
 to obtain that sword

1630
02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:19.260
 that God had given them because

1631
02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:21.260
 God has given us armor but it's

1632
02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:23.260
 up to us to take up that armor. So

1633
02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:25.260
 could you just pray for them right now?

1634
02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.260
 Yes, it is an honor.

1635
02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:29.260
 Okay, let us pray. God

1636
02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:31.260
 Almighty, the God of Abraham,

1637
02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:33.260
 Isaac, and Israel

1638
02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:35.260
 and the God of our generation

1639
02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.260
 and you see, Lord God,

1640
02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:39.260
 your people, Lord God,

1641
02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:41.260
 many are hungry, Lord

1642
02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:43.260
 God, for your presence, and

1643
02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:45.260
 many, Lord God, are struggling, Lord God,

1644
02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:47.260
 with all kinds, Lord God, of

1645
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:49.260
 depression, Lord, and many, Lord,

1646
02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:51.260
 are, Lord God, lost,

1647
02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:53.260
 sick, and dying, Lord,

1648
02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:55.260
 whether it's physical or spiritual,

1649
02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:57.260
 Lord, by you, Lord God,

1650
02:00:57.260 --> 02:00:59.260
 your love, Lord Jesus Christ,

1651
02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:01.260
 and by the blood of the Lamb, God,

1652
02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:03.260
 would you please, Lord God, by your sweet

1653
02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:05.260
 gentle Holy Spirit, embrace all

1654
02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:07.260
 of us, Lord God, especially the

1655
02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:09.260
 one, Lord God, who will

1656
02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:11.260
 listen, Lord God, right now, Lord,

1657
02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:13.260
 with whatever they're struggling,

1658
02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.260
 Lord God, with their finances, Lord God,

1659
02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:17.260
 with their relationship in their family, Lord

1660
02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:19.260
 God, with the abuse, Lord

1661
02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.260
 God, Lord, give them hope,

1662
02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:23.260
 Lord, as to what you have done

1663
02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:25.260
 to my life, Lord God, there will be

1664
02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:27.260
 many testimony, Lord God,

1665
02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:29.260
 that their brokenness, Lord God, will

1666
02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:31.260
 be the healing, Lord God, to

1667
02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:33.260
 many souls, Lord God, and let it

1668
02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:35.260
 be, Lord God, that the testimony,

1669
02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.260
 Lord God, we can, Lord God,

1670
02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:39.260
 say, Lord, is all about for

1671
02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:41.260
 your glory, and there will be many

1672
02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.260
 people, Lord God, many women that's been

1673
02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:45.260
 abused, Lord God, that's been taken captives,

1674
02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:47.260
 Lord, that there are many been struggling,

1675
02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:49.260
 Lord God, with the sin, Lord God, of

1676
02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.260
 any forms, Lord God, whether it's, Lord God,

1677
02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:53.260
 immoral sin, Lord God, or

1678
02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:55.260
 whether, Lord God, it's the sin, Lord God,

1679
02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:57.260
 that has been there, Lord God,

1680
02:01:57.260 --> 02:01:59.260
 by the ancestors, Lord God,

1681
02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:01.260
 caused by the generation, Lord God,

1682
02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:03.260
 every little thing, Lord God,

1683
02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:05.260
 you see, Lord God, in the eyes of the people,

1684
02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:07.260

1685

 we are hunger for you, Lord, and that we love

1686
02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:11.260

1687
02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.260
 Lord, according to Hebrews chapter

1688
02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:15.260
 13 verses 5, you will never

1689
02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:17.260
 leave us, nor forsake us, so

1690
02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:19.260
 Lord, this is our faith, and this is

1691
02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:21.260
 our prayer, Lord God, for in Romans chapter

1692
02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:23.260
 8, you said, Lord, that Lord God,

1693
02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:25.260
 nothing can separate us from

1694
02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:27.260
 your love, Lord, nor

1695
02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.260
 no angels, Lord God, no demons,

1696
02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.260
 nor death, Lord God, no sickness,

1697
02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.260
 Lord, nor depths, nor height, Lord,

1698
02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:35.260
 nothing can separate us from your love,

1699
02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:37.260
 and so, Lord, whoever, Lord,

1700
02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:39.260
 is listening to this prayer, Lord God, touch them,

1701
02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:41.260
 Lord God, and heal them, Lord,

1702
02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:43.260
 and let your Holy Spirit work, Lord God,

1703

 amazing way, we love you, God,

1705

 and we, Lord God, repent, Lord,

1706
02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:51.260
 and forgive for all our sins, Lord

1707
02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.260
 God, and that, Lord Jesus Christ,

1708
02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:55.260
 you are the God of many chances, Lord,

1709
02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:57.260
 Lord, give, Lord God, an open door to

1710
02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:59.260
 all of us, Lord, to come to you, Lord,

1711

02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:03.260
 name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1713
02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:05.260
 for yours is the kingdom, and the power,

1714
02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:07.260
 and the glory, now and forever,

1715
02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:09.260
 amen.

1716
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:11.260
 Amen, and Sandy Lynn, really quickly,

 if they want to search for it?

1719
02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:17.260
 They can find it in Amazon,

1720
02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.260
 there's also

1721

1738
02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:55.260
 today, pray this prayer

1739
02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:57.260
 with me, Dear Jesus,

1740
02:03:57.260 --> 02:03:59.260
 I admit that I'm a sinner,

1741
02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:01.260
 and am lost without you.

1742
02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:03.260
 I'm convinced that you're my only

1743
02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:05.260
 saving grace, and my only

1744
02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:07.260
 hope. No longer do I

1745
02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:09.260
 want to do life without you.

1746
02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:11.260
 I believe that you came to earth

1747
02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:13.260
 to die on the cross for my sins,

1748
02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:15.260
 rose from the dead three

1749
02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:17.260
 days later, and are coming back

1750
02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:19.260
 for me one day soon.

1751
02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:21.260
 Please come into my heart,

1752
02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:23.260
 and be my Lord, Savior,

1753
02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:25.260
 and friend.

1754
02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:27.260
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1755
02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:29.260
 If you've prayed that

1756
02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:31.260
 prayer, get yourself a Bible,

1757
02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:33.260
 and read it daily, and ask God

1758
02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:35.260
 to interpret every word for you.

1759
02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:37.260
 Then surround yourself with

1760
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:39.260
 like-minded believers in Jesus Christ.

1761
02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:41.260
 Congratulations,

1762
02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:43.260
 and welcome to the family.

1763
02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:45.260
 Would you believe Jennifer

1764
02:04:45.260 --> 02:04:47.260
 Bagnasi's book, I Saw God

1765
02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.260
 Last Night, is not only a page

1766
02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:51.260
 turner, but readers are right.

1767
02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:53.260
 You won't be able to put it down,

1768
02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.260
 but strap on your seatbelt, and

1769
02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:57.260
 get ready for a supernatural ride.

1770
02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:59.260
 Prepare to be captured

1771
02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.260
 on an enticing journey along

1772
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:03.260
 one person's true life story

1773
02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:05.260
 of multiple face-to-face encounters.

1774
02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:07.260
 you

1775
02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:09.260
 you

1776
02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:11.260
 you
