            <p>Hi, everyone. This is Jennifer Bagnasi with Deep Believer. Our guest today saw heaven twice, once when she was young, the other when she was older. When she was older, she was actually escorted to the artillery room in heaven. Not only that, but she accidentally got wrapped up into witchcraft, and when she did, she was actually taken into different realms through portals and tormented. But not only that, she mentioned something that is happening right now. A lot of people are being taken into false paradises. People are having NDE experiences that actually are not from God, but they think they're in heaven. So she's here to explain why that is so, and she gives us detail.

            <p>So I will start when I was young. I was one and a half year old when my parents abandoned me because of poverty, and my dad is into drugs. And so they got separated when my mom was about to go to Saudi Arabia. I was one and a half year old, and she just told me that she's going to buy candy in the store. But she didn't come back for years. And that's the story that she told me. She honestly told me that she lied when she needed to go, but it's really painful on her side too.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>I was raised as a pagan, Jennifer. So there's no person who's telling me who is Jesus about the Bible, about God. So in the Philippines, Jennifer, we are majority Catholic, but I was raised as a pagan. And being raised as a pagan, I grew up full of fears and anxiety. This time of my life is really hard for me. This is very, very hard, abandonment issues and all sorts of abuse. So I'm not going to put in detail so much about it, but the abuse started when I was really young. It's somehow close to me, that person. And from there, everything started to get dark in my life and with the way I walked until I grew up.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So at that time where I was a pagan and growing up with not having so many things, God already showed me this vision when I was five years old. So this open vision is, I will never forget this. Even until now, it's just amazing. So everyone was sleeping at this time, Jennifer, and we were in a very small apartment in Manila. And there's this window there in our room. As soon as I woke up that early morning, I heard this music. It's really the one that captivates me. It's the one that really drew me to go and look up at the sky.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>On that vision, the music keeps on playing. Just seeing what I'm seeing at that time, it's the first time I experienced that joy, that love. When I saw the man on the road, the image of him there in the sky, what really I couldn't forget were his eyes. Even though he didn't speak to me, he's telling me of his love. He's telling me that he's the embodiment of all the goodness and love of joy, that peace that transcends human understanding. It's the first time I experienced that. I thought it's an imagination or something because I'm confused when I was young. But it's very vivid; I could not forget that.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And then there's another instance. It also happened in the same place, in the apartment, but I was outside at this time, Jennifer. And then suddenly I was, you know, maybe anticipating or expecting I would see another vision because I'm really after that amazing feeling. And so I looked up again at that time and I saw this open heaven. It's like the cloud had bursting colors; it's like gold, but then beyond that, there were so many bursting colors. It's so beautiful.

            <p>And there's this river. And now that I'm a Christian, I read that in Revelation where I think it is the river of living water. I cannot describe in my human understanding how the place is; it's simply beautiful but alive, something miraculous and majestic about that place.

The mother should be the one who prays fervently for their children.

Every time things happened, I felt like it was my fault because maybe I'm too weak to resist or couldn't do something about it.

You can't even talk to any man because if my dad found out, there's that physical abuse. And also poverty is another reason because since my dad not providing anything, she needs to step and find a good life for us. Those are what my mom keeps on always telling us, the reason why she needs to leave us. But of course it doesn't really make sense to me. All I just understand is the fear of just seeing her always leaving us.

            <p>And I know you said that you were in the occult. Is that because you saw people in the occult around you? Yes, because they were our neighbors, Jennifer. When I was young, I think it was around the nineties. Christianity was not so popular in our town, it was in the province in Philippines. We deeply believed more in the elders who would tell us stories about aswang and witches and those paganism practices. We were raised in a discipline where the parents would say, "If you're not going to behave, I'm going to give you to aswang." That's how we were motivated by fear to behave. Growing up like that was crazy.

However, I felt strongly that this wasn't my life. I had dreams and believed in their possibility and didn't embrace the bleak future foretold by the medium.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Jennifer, one of the most special moments in my life happened when I was 12 years old. There was a person in our province who held a Bible and shared the gospel with us. It was very odd to me, this kind of belief, the first time I'd encountered it. Of all the things he said about worship and Jesus enthroning you, one thing struck me the most: he said that God can be your father. At that time, I believe God used that word because the desperation of me having a father drew me to Him.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>I was so hungry to have that father figure and prayed fervently as a twelve-year-old girl: "God, if you're real like what this man says, and you can be my father, can you be my father?" That prayer stayed with me until this day; God remembered that prayer of that twelve-year-old girl. As soon as I started to pray and learn how to pray to Him, my journey of having Him as my dad began and everything started to become beautiful.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>But there was a problem: I accepted Him as my savior but not as my Lord because I wasn’t deeply rooted in the word. It's very important for Christians to be deeply rooted in God's word. My relatives initially allowed me to attend Bible study because they thought it wouldn't harm our beliefs and saw it as a passing phase.

            <p>At home, they mocked me for bringing a Bible and praying but noticed that the feisty and rebellious child was changing. The one who used to street fight was now smiling and filled with joy. They sensed that the Bible study was affecting me.

            <p>One Sunday while ironing my clothes for church, they confronted me about going there. They thought Christianity involved brainwashing and didn't want me influenced by it. Despite their protests and beatings from trying to stop me, I secretly sneaked out to attend church because I longed for experiencing this father figure promised.

            <p>Um, she really looked innocent but she gave me this paper. It's just an ordinary paper, Jennifer. And then she told me, "Hey, you want something cool? You read this tonight." I was like, "Okay." And it's like, you know, we're hungry for, you know, something—power or something magic, you know, so cool, something like that. So that night I read that chant. It is a chant the way it's written. It's a chant. And now, um, going back, I just opened my Bible and I see the name of that thing that I summoned. I didn't realize. And Jennifer, this is no ordinary demon. It's something—it's in the Bible actually; Paul mentioned that. Yeah, I don't want to say her name.

            <p>So when you say you mentioned this chant, this is how you accidentally fell into witchcraft because your friend gave you this paper to, I guess, speak aloud and you did it? Yeah, he came out. No, that's another thing about these entities. When they come and visit you, they're always sending someone, you know? Like, different this night, different this night. So I don't know—based on my experience of all these spirits I saw, I think I got to see her. But I'm really definitely 100% sure when I started that and I summoned the name, nothing happened. You know? It's like I just read it like a normal thing; nothing happened. Okay. You know? I was actually waiting, anticipating when nothing happened.

            <p>And then after that night and the next following night—I was college at this time—this is something beyond me, Jennifer. I didn't realize I opened a portal because, like what I said, I grew up as a pagan and sometimes they made us drink this Latin paper. They roll it and they make us drink it. You know? So many paganism practices. So I'm not really unfamiliar with this—I'm so used to those. So that's why for me just reading this is like something... I don't know how that—this is a big deal though.

            <p>So at the time, as soon as that portal opened they just come sometimes by group, sometimes one. And you really sense the evil presence. It's like if I will describe this evil presence—they have different levels of evil presence although they are evil. The level of their evil presence is different: some are really way thicker, way bigger—you know that the level of their evilness or their powers—you just kind of sense it. That's how I can describe it.

            <p>I actually really started to not go to college at that time because I feel like my mind is going insane. Like I feel like I'm going to lose it and my mental stability is not good anymore. I'm not on drugs, Jennifer. Even though I'm exposed to alcohol, drugs or being the cool kid, I'm not into drugs. That's why it's very clear to me what I see is what I saw because I'm clean—I'm not into drugs at the time when that happens.

            <p>Every night I have a nightmare. At this time I'm not aware about astral projection; it's not being—I'm not educated about astral projection but I didn't realize I'm doing an astral projection at that time. It's like I was way too advanced. Sometimes in my house, in our house—I was just sitting and somewhere my body is going to be lifted and it's just like a blink and I was in this place—that's how fast and how crazy it is.

            <p>There's this instance that I was in college at this time and I'm the very first in that room in my classroom. So I'm waiting for my teacher and for my classmates. So while waiting, I just sit on my teacher's desk and I didn't realize I fell asleep. They said to me for 45 minutes I'm unconscious—no matter what they did they couldn't wake me up. They said, "What's going on with you?" And then my classmates made jokes like, "Do that next time so we'll have no class interruption," something like that.

And you know the difference about being visited by those demons is you just feel somewhere inside you that's been trespassed and you couldn't even shake off that filthy feeling—like you're being spiritually abused or it's just dirty—that's how I felt.

            <p>That time when my classmates were trying to wake me up, I was actually in a different place—this realm that I saw. The first realm that I saw—I couldn't forget this place—it looks like there's no sky. Can you imagine that? There is no sky but it looks like somehow like a glass on top but it's not the glass that we have here on earth; it's like something watery-looking material.

            <p>There's this dead tree—and you know what? In the Bible in Genesis—I don't know why God really has something to do with the tree—because in the time of Adam and Eve there's the tree of good and evil and there's the tree of knowledge—and even in heaven there is the tree of life. In this realm it's very striking to me—I saw this tree as this huge dead tree in that place. It's very cracked and dry and every time I try to run it's like you're trapped in that realm—every time you try to run you go back to the beginning.

            <p>You know, really passionate for Jesus Christ.

It's like a place where you're kind of like a nothingness. It's like a nothingness generally. It's like a place like an airport where you land first before you go to some certain, you know, they are also organized in Rome. They're more organized than us, you know, because, you know, it's just how things work. It's just beyond me.

            <p>That's how I can say that time. And I was just a, I just, everyone thought I'm a normal college student. Were you astral projecting and having any of these creepy visions before you did this, that chant that your friend gave to you? Yeah, that's where it started. So before then you didn't have those, you just had the experience of you when you were five seeing heaven. Yeah. It's just like some random event that I will just get to see and experience.

            <p>But I think it became so, so deep in me because Jennifer, I wanted also to, for everyone to know this, the generational bloodline of what I have, the generational curse is real. It's in the Bible. It's happened from first generation to fourth generation that it's never been caught and never been freed by the blood of Jesus Christ. And having not come to the relationship of Jesus Christ, this will go on.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And like what I said, I grew up as a pagan. So, you know, so it means that as soon as I opened the chant, I already have that deep level of ancestral connection about all these things. That's how I can think why this became so deep when I opened that portal because of the ancestral rights and the legal rights of the enemy, you know, from the generation before my forefathers to us. Yeah. Our generation. Yeah.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And I'm glad you mentioned that because a lot of people don't understand that generational curses are real and that the reason why we do experience some things that we do is because of the generational curses that say our parents or our grandparents or great grandparents or a great, great. So could you just explain a little bit about generational curses? So our audience is aware that this is real.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So the generational curses it's been mentioned in the Bible, it's actually in the Old Testament, right? That the first generation to the fourth generation, if, you know, you've been practicing, worshipping, you know, the idolatry, different gods. So the curses or the wrath, it will be from first to fourth generation. And it's a make or break. That's why, okay, I'm going to explain this in the Bible from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>You see, there is a, it's not really a deep, because they worship God, they are really faithful to that. But the sin, okay, let's just say it's that sin. Okay. So from Abraham, you know, that sin passes through Isaac into Jacob, you know, like Abraham lied, Isaac lied. And then Jacob became worse, you know, you see how it got deeper. So he betrayed.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And the fourth generation, which is Joseph, like isn't really in a bad, bad place, because for him, you know, for that to happen, you know, yeah, so that's why, you know, it's been, you know, in slavery and abandonment, like so much things happened to him, but he never did anything. But, you know, God break the curse, and that generational curse, through the time of Joseph when you know.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Yeah, there are five tests Jennifer. There are five tests in the life of a child of God: the test of time, the test of faith, the test of purity, the test of forgiveness and the test of love. And with what happened to Joseph is the test of purity and he passed that. You know it's amazing! So that's just it's not really a curse we're talking about here. It is just a sin.

            <p>I mean not just sorry because sin is a really big thing I mean it's serious. I don't want them to take it lightly so yeah I don't want it to be misunderstood but what I mean is they didn't do idolatry but they sin and that's what happened it passes. And if it was being cut off from the first to the next following generation it will be a blessing. You know like it's a blessing.

            <p>You know that's also what the Bible mentioned remember? Yeah so that's why you know in the Davidic timeline in Solomonic timeline with David there's lots of fights he go into a lot of fights you know and then by the time he didn't pass to Solomon it's like a time of peace in the kingdom because the word is obedience I think that is the best word is that obedience and you know our full devotion to the one true God which is Jesus Christ.

            <p>And with my ancestral like what I said the Christian generation that we have I mean a lot of stuff I mean in our town there's this you can search it also on YouTube like someone's dancing on the fire I mean you know like those are you know like they summon demons to do that and when I was young I couldn't forget this one where I saw this woman he counted something and immediately that possessed lady the spirit transferred to the animal and of course they need to kill the animal immediately.

            <p>So as soon as they kill the animal immediately something come out from it I was just like what is that I just saw it! I was just so scary I was so scared at that time like oh wow this is real so by the time I was young I already know that they're existing and the evil exists even though they want to make us look that they're just a figure of imagination but not where I grew up.

I was really actually looking for my friend like I wanted to understand what's going on what did you give me but guess what she transferred from a different university. I was like she's not there.

            <p>You know I'm like oh wow like she just fulfilled whatever she needs to fulfill you know and so there's this one there's this story but this doesn't happen when I was in college somehow I was graduated already you know like I was actually like started to know God and I think the enemy is trying to prevent me to really give my loyalty to God's kingdom.

            <p>And so I was taken into this place where it is it is in my human perception for our listener to kind of really imagine this it looks like a warehouse but it's a realm okay when it's like a warehouse it looks like that and then this woman this little girl she's little girl.

            <p>Like what I said before I often see them visiting or I often see them talking like that or showing things in the realm but this one is different because the evil presence of that girl she's not a girl she's not an ordinary girl she is full of you know like she learned so many cunning ways that's how I can describe it she's full of craftiness.

            <p>Because somehow, when you have this kind of experience, I'm still on the point where I'm still studying, Jennifer. I'm still learning and doing a lot of research about what I experienced. So I'm listening and trying to ask the Holy Spirit and ask God if this near-death experience is from Him. There are many ridiculous near-death experiences that I'm hearing a lot. That, okay, okay, go on, that kind of experience is not a real heaven, it is an illusion. And I think that kind of entity, because she has that full power, she can manifest a place where it is a very illusion place.

So we got out of that warehouse and there's that paradise. Jennifer, it's so beautiful. There's flowers, the grass is so green, like very green. And there's also little children like her, they're playing and they're having fun of their life. And then she said, go on. She said to me, go, go there, walk. But something is odd about this place. Something is odd.

And if I embrace the thing that, okay, I am in heaven, I'm doomed. She was going to trap me in there because I put my faith in the belief that that place is a paradise. But because this is how I kind of really try to really analyze this, how this evil girl will give me a paradise? I mean, how will she able to bring me there? She is no angel, you know?

            <p>And even though I have a little knowledge about the Bible when I was young, God sealed me. When I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, I think that's what really kept me from discerning that it is a false paradise. There's also light in that place, Jennifer. This is like a paradise where there is light, but the light there is different. It's not compared to the light of God. It's different.

I don't know where she come up with that, but the place looks like afternoon. Afternoon in the paradise is what it looks like. It looks so gloomy. And the more I look at the place, suddenly, while she keeps on convincing me to go in there, a place where they sit like a bench.

I'm like, if this is real paradise, there should not be any like this.

            <p>So, now, that man, he just said, this is the last time we remember he said, he's going to get married to that woman. After that, he is somewhere now where he's talking to someone constantly and looking at. And then, you know, he has a certain place where he's just so happy. He's very, very happy. Now, he's in our world. Like, he's functioning his physical body here, but he's not here. His mind is someplace else.

            <p>Yeah, yeah. I mean, and this is the doctor telling, he's perfectly normal before. But now, seeing him, he's not. And he's like digging, digging, digging. He just digs something from the forest. Something. It's like something ridiculous that this woman is trying to manipulate this man. And, yep, until his subconscious is not there.

            <p>Back to the NDEs, the near death. And then we'll move on a little bit now. So, are you saying that if someone sees their relatives, say a child that passed away or your mother or your grandmother or your husband that passed away, if you're dying and you see that, that's not God. But if you see angels or Jesus, then you know that's from the Lord.

            <p>And also, I really wanted to encourage everyone to really get into the word of God, to pray, you know, worship, do this spiritual discipline. Because even though sometimes they said they are angel, you know.

            <p>Okay, so maybe I need to tell you this, Jennifer. So, did you know some demons are naked? Like they are naked. I don't know why they are naked. Anyway, so this one, he said, I am Jesus, like that. And I'm like, no, you're not Jesus.

            <p>This is like another thing. Sometimes the level of your spiritual assignment is the level of the devil's spiritual assignment that they're going to give to you. Like before, it's like a little demon and then now it's like this deception of fake Jesus.

            <p>Like what you said Jennifer we need to pay attention to also you know that you know that Jesus there is no doubt when it is Jesus it is 100% you know it's Jesus because he's the only one who can bring that presence the very pure presence of love that kind of pure kind of love.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>You need to really pray because that's really something very concerning and dangerous yeah even the angel sometimes you know there was this like time that you know when the angel visited you when it comes from the Lord they also bring that kind of presence even though they look like a very serious type of angel because some angels really look like okay yeah like something you cannot mess up with.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>But you know it is the angel of God because they also had carried that light that presence of God but some angel that say angel like that sometimes you're kind of really they're not because sometimes they're just vile you know and you will really know it because they couldn't really kept the goodness they just couldn't do it they can act for a while but they just going to blow their whatever they made up yeah.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So yeah I'm encouraged for everyone not to be deceived you know to really come to Jesus Christ and to really read your Bible once again really get into the word and the Holy Spirit ask the Holy Spirit to really understand what the word of God is those are basic but Jennifer those are really something that will going to lead us to not be deceived because nowadays this is actually what's going on is there's a very very fine line of truth.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>You know the deception nowadays is like a strand of hair that's how dangerous we are living in right now and they're working in any system in the world especially in the rich country in the regional system in government in everywhere they're just that influence and you know why it's happening because America in the history was once a Biblical grounded society and nation they loved the word of God.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        
  
  
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And then suddenly America turned into embracing the Eastern religion embracing all kinds of belief and in the Bible when Israel commit idolatry by turning away setting up altars this God or this entity fallen angels and many things they're being summoned.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        
  
  
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And nowadays everyone's starting to always build an altar if you notice that building on altars building on altars is summoning them and like going to new age movement about the universe and everything so that is really summoning them to come back.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        
  
  
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And that is people telling that they are refusing God and they're refusing Jesus Christ and if you notice the faith of the grateful always getting weaker and weaker in Christianity because we embrace again that different belief and it's very sad.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And that's why I'm encouraging everyone Jesus Christ is the only specific address to heaven in first Corinthians chapter 13 no matter how you discover the mysteries you can speak the language of angels.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

            <p>Sandy Lynn so you gave your life to Jesus when you were 12 years old but yet you had these demonic encounters and there are some Christians who believe that once you become born again these things can't happen to you but why do you believe this happened to you giving your life to Jesus even when you were 12 years old?

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Yes like what I said Jennifer I gave my life to Jesus Christ when I was 12 I thought I accept him as my Lord and savior but I only accept him as my savior and not my Lord because for him to be the Lord of your life Jesus said if you love me you obey my command and that's where I don't have that in me I am a Christian yes.

            <p>To keep and let the time pass until it, you know, comes true but this one is okay. You need to tell this because this is not only for you but for the forerunners of faith. God emphasized to me first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 to 26, if I remember it right, about the forerunners, so I'm going to emphasize this story about the race.

            <p>In my dream, Jennifer, I saw this angel. I'm actually getting familiar with them because every time, every year, if God is going to do something in that year or I need to pray for certain places, certain people, or churches, God is going to show it to me or I will have a very special angel visitation. Like what I said, it is not for entertainment; it always has to do with advancing God's kingdom and his purpose. Glory to Jesus Christ.

            <p>They said, "I'm here." As soon as they said that, I was transported and I saw these four angels. I didn't forget them—they have no wings by the way—but they look so pure, kind, and meek but there's something about their authority. I think that's the right word—the authority that they have. It's like that kind of angel you do not want to mess up with. In that place, I felt like a child, like a very excited child because this is what they said to me: "You are in the training." That's what they said to me. I mean how many training sessions, you know? I think this is the third or the fourth time I heard them say that. So I said, "Okay, I'm in the training."

I saw different swords and not a single one of them was the same. They are so uniquely designed in many ways. There's one thing I want you to know about certain things there in the room or in heaven in general: here on earth when we use a spoon or any non-living things, they are truly non-living—they're not breathing or anything—but in heaven, everything is alive. It's like the trees, the flowers, everything is alive.

            <p>All my years of being a missionary and walking with Jesus Christ I've always encountered Ephesians 6 about the armor of God. I thought that the sword of the spirit was a metaphor because it was something that you learn—like the belt of truth to protect you through truth so you will have confidence, gospel shoes, the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness, the shield of faith, and the sword of the spirit. So I thought all those were metaphors. But the angel explained to me that all the children of God have a very special sword designed for them.

            <p>I was so amazed because I was like "I never knew this was real!" Something that you really have in spiritual battle. When I saw them they weren't just on shelves or hanging; it's like they are alive! They are so bright and floating. The room felt full of joy—it’s hard to explain but they almost had personalities. It’s amazing how experiences like that allow you to understand and describe what you see so you can be a witness.

            <p>The angel then said, "Today we are going to give you a new sword." My joy doubled! Inside I was jumping for joy but I tried to remain proper facing this angel. Then the angel said, "But you need to pass a test." That caught me off guard. So then they asked me, "What's in your hand?" All of a sudden I realized I'd been holding a sword all along but it was so small, almost like a dagger. It looked worn out from many battles.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>They said in exchange for that worn-out sword, I would get a new one after passing the test. Everything happened so fast. They sat me down and gave me something that looked like a diamond crystal, pure and clear. They placed it inside me at my knee without any pain—very meticulous like the best surgeon without any discomfort.

            <p>When they placed it in my knee, they said in times when I need help in the test they could come to the rescue quickly. As soon as they said that, we were at a place with two roads—this wasn’t heaven. From shadows and smoke emerged two humanoid figures—a man and a woman who were definitely demons but in human form. They were looking at each other fiercely.

            <p>The angel said I was going to run a race with these two creatures and needed to win or else they would get my reward. Then without a countdown or anything, the race began. In that realm there is no element of time; we don’t use our feet but become light while running. These two demonic figures turned into shadow-like forms too.

            <p>By God's grace, I won the race! When we returned to the starting place—two crossroads—the angel next to me said I had won. My reward appeared in my hand: it looked like a potter’s jug filled with oil. Holding the oil felt heavy and sacred; it made me bend my knee and kneel down in surrender before handing it over to the angel.

            <p>Back at the artillery room again, relief washed over me. Despite knowing there would be bigger battles ahead—because why else would I be given a new sword—I felt regenerated and joyful again as four glowing swords soared towards me and stood in front of me.

            <p>Gold and has that you know like that gold that's kind of really arranged neatly you know that's kind of really um you know twist nicely you know that that's that's the first sword it's so beautiful it's just beautiful. And then the other one it looks like green emerald that's how I can describe it, it's like green emerald and it has that inscription it's like a language. But this one I really don't understand what's that it's like that language, I don't know because it's like a symbol, it's just a symbol, it's like a different language. And um, um, it also looks beautiful and the way when I say beautiful it's like a different level of beauty. Like this one looks like you know like um elegant, like refined, something like that you know.

            <p>And this one, this green emerald, it looks like a deep ocean. It's like um it's just captivating, it's like shimmery you know, it's like when the ocean is shining when it's being heated by the sun something like that. It's just beautiful you know. And then the third one, this one really gets my attention because that one is pure crystal glass. It looks like diamond, I'm not sure if it's like pure crystal glass diamond, like the purity of that you can really see, you know the see-through because it's so clear. It's so beautiful and it has embedded different jewels, different gems, different stones and the stones really complement what that diamond sword looks like. It's so beautiful I'm like wow you're so beautiful, I'm like talking to the sword. It sounds crazy but I'm talking to these swords, that's how I can describe it.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And then the last one um this one it looks um it's not really earthly material but it looks so okay so this is how I can describe it. You know when you see a mountain in the land, the grass and the mountain, like that kind of beauty you know when you see the field of land mountain grass that kind of beauty like we appreciate that. So that's what it looks like but it looks like um a material like leather, like a leather in our earth but it weaves. The weaving is, the detail of how it weaves tells a story; it's not just randomly weaves just because. It means every part of the weave tells a story and it has a very specific symbol why. Like God never creates something that doesn't have any purpose. He is the God of detail, he's just a God of detail; he's so detailed in this very very perfect way. It's just amazing. That's the beauty of this one.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So, you know while they were standing and one thing I also noticed about them they are so bright, like shiny shiny bright; it's just hard to explain the brightness where it's so bright but at the same time you can really look at it. That kind of brightness isn't like it didn't hurt your eyes. And you know one thing that I noticed about this sword when I go to differentiate it to the sword here on earth: the sword here on earth when you hold it you know it's a weapon for killing, it's a weapon to slash or to draw on you know aim, you know like that. But the sword that I saw is alive, so it doesn't look really for use for maybe because if you're a child of God, um, it doesn't look scary or harmful. It just looks so gentle; it's like a friend. This I can say: it's like a sword, a friend; something like a sword that you want in your journey that you will never get bored of having because it's something that you know is so gentle. The sword that is so gentle, so joyful because they have different personalities because they look so joyful they look so you know pull up spark sort of bursting goodness in them.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So that's the kind of sword that these four swords look like. And so when I was about to choose it Jennifer when I was about to get it I woke up. But the angels they're so gentle; they brought me gently in my body because I see glimpses every time they go sometimes. You know I had the chance to when I open my eyes I see a glimpse of light when they put me back into my room and I woke up like I'm holding something. I was like, and I was like you know like I got it. I'm just sorry to spoil you though they didn't tell me what did I choose. That's why even for me it's like they kept this as a mystery to me but what I can assure is I have it because as soon as I wake up I'm like a child, I get up and I'm trying to yes I have it. You know that you have it and then I was so excited.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>I'm going to confess this to you Jennifer when I read the Bible there are parts in the Bible that I'm really not interested in: like the bloodline, like the names you know. But as soon as I get this there's that deep deep hunger for the Word of God that when I read the bloodline I'm like wow tell me about it. I'm doing a lot of research about who this person is; like the bloodline of Jesus Christ, like what I said in Matthew chapter 1: 14 generations from Abraham to David; David to captivity in Babylon and Babylon going to Jesus' generation. And then you know I'm like oh wow I never see this before now Jennifer. Now I realize that if God puts something in there whether it looks boring for someone – like names or blood – God put in there for a purpose. God really put in there for a purpose and that opens me up to so many things that I never saw before. It's like a mystery.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So when I open the Word of God and that's why I understand: okay so that's why it is the sword of the spirit. It's something that's going to have a purpose in me and now I'm sharing the message during Bible study and the Holy Spirit...it's like people will tell me "that's exactly pierced my heart" or "that's exactly the word I need". I'm like Holy Spirit; God this is you! Yeah that's what they said to me: "this is God". You just don't say it randomly; it's like you don't know what I'm going through but what you say that's exactly what I need and sometimes it became healing; that word of God.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
        </p>
            
        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And sometimes it's just now I'm like: God who am I going to minister today? And God will exactly give me the right word and I'm amazed because it's not just saying something randomly; it also has a purpose in my daily life and with ministering to others. Now when I see people it's different; it's like God gave me a glimpse of how he feels when I look at people. They are lost, sick or dying; I always have that pain in me that makes me go somewhere silently or secretly and pray for that person. If I'm not going to pray for that person or church or community God will not let me sleep. So I see now God really loves not only children of God not only Christians He also loves the lost; He's been searching for them and the Holy Spirit is working hard in our generation because we are in God's grace period and there will come a time when it runs out.

        </div>
         
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So the passion and compassion for the loss – that's the happiness I feel right now when I look at people –I feel like embracing them; feel like praying for them because of such deep love which I've never experienced before in my walk. As I've said before: I'm a missionary who's taken care of many children but this kind of love is different and now in this year that is God's calling. This is another thing Jennifer: God said share this because it is not for you alone but for all children of God who need to pick up their swords again.

        </div>
        
    
    
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>I must emphasize that: child of God, you need to pick up your sword because we are living in times where we need God desperately. It's a call to arms Jennifer; it's a battle as stated in 1 Corinthians 9:24-26: you are forerunners of faith and need to win this race with help from the Holy Spirit enabling us all to win.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>God's calling right now Jennifer is heavenly mindedness needed because Christians are becoming too earthly minded thus useless for heaven's kingdom purposes which grieves God's heart immensely seeing distractions pull Christians away from focusing on Him even if only an hour or minute each day could change things.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So despite challenges regarding focus Christians face today needing God every day even briefly acknowledging these swords symbolize callings available upon repentance offering access into Jesus' kingdom making Christians responsible wielding swords positively rather than negatively slashing brethren rising above such tendencies focusing lovingly upon responsibilities praying endearingly towards transforming communities however challenging such walks remain gentle divine guidance proving uplifting fulfilling purposes across ministries akin alongside reconciliations realized even amidst initial difficulties akin reconciliation eventual soothing thereby demonstrating transformative inner workings – ultimately leading towards comprehensive deeper healings understanding unfolded forgiveness journeys toward eventual ministerial callings acknowledged effectively throughout.

            <p>Is like the image of God in me. Like I'm always asking, where were you when I was abused, when I was in pain, when I was being tortured, where were you? And that's my question with God. Maybe in the other story, I'm going to tell that but this time I wanted to end it that God really showed me, you know the miracle power of forgiveness and how before my dad died, 2016 when he died, that's where we got to reconcile, we got forgiveness and right now, Jennifer established five churches in Philippines two I got visit and they helped me in the ministry, you know. Some of them really active in helping me with the mission and the seeds that my dad planted, you know it's growing. He died but he left a legacy of Jesus Christ in the hearts of many homeless, drug recovery people. It's just a very amazing story that I really wanted to share.

Yes, Before Eternity and then there's a subtitle, The One Who Dwells in Zion and this is a story about a woman who's been in a Christian journey. It's an adventure filled book, post-apocalyptic something to do, you know, with what happened, you know, to the earth and also the journey going from the very, very dark to coming to light and coming to the cross to Jesus Christ and going back to your first love.

Could you pray for everyone watching right now who have been through, even been through, I guess, what you've been through, if not worse or even better, you know, but could you just pray for them in their walk with Jesus and that they'll learn to obtain that sword that God had given them because God has given us armor but it's up to us to take up that armor.

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"As soon as that portal opened, they come."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"Sometimes they come by group, and sometimes one."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"You sense the evil presence."</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I fell asleep on my teacher's desk."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I was unconscious for 45 minutes."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"They couldn't wake me up."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"My classmates joked about it."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I couldn't stop it."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"Being visited by those demons feels like being spiritually abused."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"The first realm I saw looks like there is no sky."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"The top looks like a watery material."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"There was a dead tree in that place."</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"Every time I tried to run, I went back to the beginning."</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"The second realm I saw was in the afternoon nap."</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"The place was gloomy."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"The atmosphere was heavy."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I found myself at the center of the ground of that place."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"There were lots of souls wearing ragged clothes."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"They were in a trance and had shackles."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"A guardian angel was leading them to their doom."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"They were falling into a big dark mouth."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"They did not realize they were falling."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I was like in an aquarium and couldn't do something about it."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I screamed to stop them, but they didn't stop."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I traveled back home with my thoughts."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I screamed Jesus to come back."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I was very thirsty when I came back to my body."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I felt very tired."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"I was mentally exhausted."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">"The tree is a place before you go to another portal or door."</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She said that she always saw that tree also.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She said it's like a portal going to a different place.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She said it's like a place where you're kind of like a nothingness.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She said it's like a place like an airport where you land first before you go to some certain place.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">They are more organized in Rome than us.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Everyone thought I was a normal college student.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Generational curses are real.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Generational curses have happened from the first generation to the fourth generation.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Generational curses have never been caught and never been freed by the blood of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Without a relationship with Jesus Christ, generational curses will go on.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She grew up as a pagan.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She had a deep level of ancestral connection.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The ancestral rights and the legal rights of the enemy have passed from the generation before her forefathers to her generation.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Generational curses are mentioned in the Bible in the Old Testament.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The first generation to the fourth generation will face curses or wrath for practicing idolatry.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The sin passed from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Abraham lied.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Isaac lied.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Jacob's sin became worse to the point of betrayal.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Joseph faced slavery and abandonment but did nothing wrong.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">God broke the generational curse through Joseph.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There are five tests in the life of a child of God: the test of time, faith, purity, forgiveness, and love.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Joseph passed the test of purity.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Obedience and devotion to the one true God, Jesus Christ, can transform a generational curse into a blessing.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">David had many fights during his time.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Solomon experienced a time of peace in the kingdom.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The evil exists, even if others want to dismiss it as a figure of imagination.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She believes in God and knows He is real because of the existence of evil.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">When the portal was opened, she wanted to understand what was going on.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She described seeing an ancient door.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The door looked ancient and had been there for a long time.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She was taken to a place that looked like a warehouse but was a different realm.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She saw an evil presence in a girl who was not an ordinary girl.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The girl dressed like someone from the distant past.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The girl laughed in an evil manner which was disturbing.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The girl showed her a man eating a meal.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The girl revealed that the food was actually rotten and nasty.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The rotten food would eventually kill the man.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The girl laughed loudly and evilly.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The girl implied that the man would die from eating the food.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She felt the girl's evil presence strongly and could not look at her.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She believed that being a spirit-filled believer would prevent entry for evil forces.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She felt that the evil girl had a very strong, dark presence.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The girl tried to create an illusion of paradise for her.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She had listened to many near-death experiences on YouTube.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Near-death experiences can be a subject of study and research.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Some near-death experiences are not real heaven but an illusion.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">An entity with full power can manifest an illusionary place resembling paradise.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Heaven can only be heaven if the presence of God is there.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Someone who has never encountered God or had a relationship with Jesus Christ may not recognize a false paradise.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There is light in the false paradise, but it is different from the light of God.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The false paradise looked gloomy, like an afternoon.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The presence of any shade of darkness indicates that it is not a real paradise.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Running back to the warehouse led back to the false paradise.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">An evil entity wanted to trap the narrator in the false paradise.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Calling out to Jesus Christ in thought led to encountering light and escaping the false paradise.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Depression is identified as another spirit operating in the world.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There is an increasing prevalence of depression.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Familiar spirits can take the form of someone recognizable.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Familiar spirits may try to convince people that the physical world and their realm are illusions.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The experience of another realm can lead to confusion about what is real.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">A high level of deception makes it difficult to identify what is real.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">False paradises and some near-death experiences are not genuinely heaven but a false reality created by Satan.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Many near-death experiences have been void of Jesus and God.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Paul's mention of visiting heaven or hell in the Bible emphasizes that such experiences should have God's permission.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">God’s permission involves being escorted by an angel for a divine purpose.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Experiences focused on feeling good, comfortable, or self-centered are likely not from God but are deceptive.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Genuine divine experiences lead to Jesus Christ.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There is only one specific way to heaven, which is through Jesus Christ.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Unauthorized entry into the spirit world is dangerous.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Some people in mental institutions might have their souls trapped in another realm.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">He always talks about this woman who is coming to him at night.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">He said this woman is no ordinary.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">She is very beautiful.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Every night he goes to the river to talk to that woman.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">No one has seen that woman.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The parents thought he might be getting crazy.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">They brought him to the mental hospital.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The doctor said he is perfectly normal.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The doctor said there is nothing wrong with him.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The condition progressed.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The man said he is going to get married to that woman.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The man is now constantly talking to someone and looking at something.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The man has a certain place where he feels very happy.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The man's physical body is functioning here, but his mind is someplace else.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The doctor initially said he was perfectly normal.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The woman is supposedly manipulating the man.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">His subconscious is not there.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">If someone sees their deceased relatives while dying, that vision is not from God.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Seeing angels or Jesus while dying indicates it is from the Lord.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Some demons appear naked.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Sometimes demons pretend to be Jesus.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The level of one's spiritual assignment influences the level of the devil’s spiritual assignment against them.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There are instances of “fake Jesus” appearing all over the world.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There is a prophecy from Revelation involving a white horseman bringing false peace for three and a half years.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Invoking the blood of Jesus Christ causes demons to change form.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There’s a belief that demons fear the blood of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">It is important to be able to distinguish genuine visits from Jesus due to the unique presence of pure love and peace.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">False visions bring doubt and fear.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Angels from the Lord bring a presence of God.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There are false angels that do not carry the presence of God.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Deception is prevalent and dangerous in current times.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Deception is particularly active in wealthy countries and governmental systems.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">America was historically a Biblical grounded society but has embraced other religions, causing spiritual decline.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Idolatry involves setting up altars for other entities or deities.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Building altars summons these entities.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There is a decline in Christian faith due to the embrace of different beliefs.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Without love, all knowledge and experiences are meaningless.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The speaker accepted Jesus as their Savior at the age of 12 but only later understood the importance of accepting Him as Lord.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Obeying Jesus' command is a sign of loving Him.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Biblical truth and the foundation of the word are important for a strong faith.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The word of God is a weapon for daily battles.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Christian life involves constant battles.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Becoming tired of fighting can weaken faith.</li>
