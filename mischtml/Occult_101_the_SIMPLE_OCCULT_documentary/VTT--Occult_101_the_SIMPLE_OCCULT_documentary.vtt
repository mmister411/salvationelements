00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 I can tell you that the occult people all believe stuff can step right out of thin air.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 That's what they write in all the documents.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 I mean, no good occultist doesn't believe... I mean, you're not a very good occultist.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 You can't get that to happen, I guess.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 I wouldn't be impressed with you.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 And since so much deals with the occult,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 it's important to understand the history behind some of the occult.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Jesus said to be wise as serpents, but gentle as doves.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 So when we look at occult, we probably ought to start in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 at some of the basic elements of it in your modern age.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 And the hero of modern occultism, or one of them,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 would be, of course, Aleister Crowley, seen here with the eye on top of his head,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 the pyramid eye on top of his head.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And that symbol right there, it's only really appropriate

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 that that symbol begin to take its rise again as you lead towards the end.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 That symbol is the 70.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Images of that rotating thing captured by U.S. Navy aircraft,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 sensors locking in on the target.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Commander David Fravor saw it firsthand during a training mission,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 describing it like a 40-foot-long tic-tac.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 This entity called Lamb, he claimed would physically manifest

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 in the midst of some of these rituals.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 It is also believed to be the first drawing in modern history

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 of what today is called a gray alien.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 That's kind of interesting, isn't it?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 This is a story that starts with a snake.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 This show has closely followed the possibility there could be

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 unknown entities in the skies above us, I believe that,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 but could they be even closer than that, right here?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 A new Wall Street Journal report profiles the many parents

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 who think they can see ghosts, specters, and mysterious movements

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 on their advanced baby monitors.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Well, the UFO phenomenon, it was always there.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Oh, man, it's breaking our physics.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Maneuvering rapidly and changing direction.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 And as we both looked out the right side of our airplane,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 we saw a disturbance in the water and a white object,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 oblong, pointing north.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 The object was first sighted in 2004,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 then similar objects again in 2015.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 But, I mean, the objects were always, I mean, the whole UFO phenomenon

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 would just appear and then disappear.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 So the question becomes, where's it when you don't see it?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And there's so many of them, man.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 People catch these on their cell phones everywhere.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 It sounds like it's not coming from other planets.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 It's almost like it's a more localized phenomenon.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Do that which is coming, as it were, indeed,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 know you what entities that are in arrow ships?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 What call them?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Aliens.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Ah, but they are not aliens.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 ETs.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 ETs.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Extraterrestrial.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Indeed.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Humanity.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 That which is called they will become very much a part,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 as it were, indeed, of your plane.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 There's a whole fleet of them.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Look on the ASA.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 My gosh.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 They're all going against the wind.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 The wind's 120 miles from the west.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 A whole thing, dude.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 This was extremely abrupt, like a ping-pong ball bouncing off a wall.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 The ability to hover over the water and then start a vertical climb

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 from basically zero up towards about 12,000 feet

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 and then accelerate in less than two seconds and disappear

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 is something I had never seen in my life.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Now, over here, just like we have the Enki being summonsed

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 at the Tower of Babel, who steps forth from another reality

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 to see Nimrod.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Do you know any Nimrods in your world?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Well, and Aleister Crowley, the same with his pyramid up here,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 stated this character, this alien-looking thing,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 would step through from another dimension,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 accompanied by this Sumerian, Assyrian, ancient Kang.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Isn't that interesting?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 That means a baby is there.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Some parents describe blurry humanoid figures.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Others say they see floating white orbs.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Brett Larson is a host for Fox News Headlines 24-7.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 He joins us. What's the deal?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 It's an interesting one, right?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 As more of us put cameras in our homes, we're catching some unusual events,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 and some think, well, if I look over here,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 here's Manly P. Hall, a 33rd-degree Freemason.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Black magician Elias Levy, that's him up here,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 is depicted, pictured above, using a grimoire.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 That's a book of ritual magic.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 He has opened a portal to the dark world, right there,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 to summons an ancient wisdom demon called a Yoda.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 So that's what stepped through.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 So the circle he's got under him, with the pentagrams and all of this,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 he's created another pentagram over there,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 where he will summons the Yoda that will come through.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 I don't know how in the Star Wars films you could ever copyright the Yoda,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 because I see Yoda dolls everywhere,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 and I'm assuming that Star Wars believes it owns those.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 I don't know how possibly you could copyright that,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 since it's really just hijacking stuff from Manly P. Hall,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 who was hijacking stuff previously from Elias Levy.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And this could be considered fairly modern occult,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 because occult goes all the way back to the serpent at the beginning.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 So we're taking a journey into the dimensions.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 So here's our little snake guy.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Now, the word serpent there is actually going to be Nakosh,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 the Nakosh that was in the garden.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Just as there were two trees in the garden,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 we're going to find that history also has two paths, a choice.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Look up Trey Smith's Choice.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 That's a video that a lot of people, it's buried,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 a lot of my stuff gets buried now on the internet.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 It used to not be, but you've got to search for it by name now.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Trey Smith's Choice.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 You'll find a set of three videos, coincidentally,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 that you may just like when you finish this.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 I pray the blood of Jesus and a protection

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 over everything that you're about to watch in this video.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 As we go through some of the history of the occult

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 and all of the books, the materials that I'm reading out of

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 are available over at GodInANutShell.com

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Now the serpent was more crafty, crafty, witchy, witchy.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Arum is the word there.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Arum.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Arum than any of the other beasts of the field

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 that the Lord God had made.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 And when they ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 the word for naked right afterwards is arum.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Man had just taken on a property of the serpent.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 The occult, all of the demons and devils and all of that

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 are really good guys.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 In the Torah, in the Bible, they're bad guys.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 In fact, the word demon means wise.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Means wise is what it means.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Now I'm going to skip you forward.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 I'm going to skip you forward to right over here.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 We're going to come into the book of Nimrod

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 because this is where our occult gets deep and thick.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 The iron is a powerful symbol for God,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 but is copied by the demonic.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 The iron, as with the aleph.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 The aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 It's the silent letter.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Letter that starts everything, yet it's silent.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 It's hidden.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 It's there, but it's not there, yet it starts everything.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 The iron is like that letter.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 It is silent letter.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 The iron is said to see, but it does not speak.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 It represents the light of God from Genesis 1-3.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 However, in Matthew 6, 22-23, it states,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 if the eye be the evil eye, if the eye be the evil eye,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 the iron ra is what that's called.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 The evil eye.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Then how great is that darkness?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Now Alistair Crowley, seen over here,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 and this is a role model for a lot of these

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 modern day witchy groups.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And a lot of these modern day witchy groups,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 they have a lot of prophecies of their own.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And this is something, if you're in one of those groups,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 what I might consider is how many times in the past,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 when you've been in your group,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 and it doesn't matter whether you're a billionaire

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 or whether you're a guy that just entered

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 and doesn't know nothing about it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 How many times have their models on stuff been wrong?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Just a question.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 There's something wrong with the prophecies.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 There's something wrong with the things

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 speaking on the other side

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 if you can't get stuff right all the time, huh?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 I'm banking it fails you hard in the end.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 These are the same little guys, by the way.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 This is the same stuff that people describe

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 in going to hell experiences.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 And I've listened to lots and lots

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 and lots of those over time.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 These are the things that oftentimes

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 those hell experiences, right?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 When they die, they're conscious,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 they're looking around,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 and before they go downward,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 like a tractor beam takes them down, right?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 It's ugly.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Oh, it shakes them.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 If they...

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 These little dudes come out on a podium,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 except they're uglier than that.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 And they're laughing at you.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Anyhow, we'll continue.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 This was one of Crowley's guides.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 He called it Lamb.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Isn't that priceless?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Crowley is likely the most famous occultist

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 in modern history,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 living from 1875 to 1947.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Now, that's the year the aliens crashed in Roswell,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 isn't it?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 It's also the same year that

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 that Israel became a nation.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Isn't that funny?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 You're 70 years from all of that,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 right here on this page.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 It is the symbol one would expect to find

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 leading towards the end times.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 So, the end times.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 The ayin.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 It's a symbol you'd expect to appear.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It means 70.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Israel just had their 70th anniversary.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 I was at it.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 The CCP, the Chinese Communist Party government

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 just celebrated their...

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 You've got a lot of 70s popping up.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 70 there.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And also the symbol for Daniel's 70th week.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 So, your entire revelation in times

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 with the Antichrist and all of this

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 occurs in what's known as Daniel's 70th week.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 So, it should be appropriate

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 that that ayin pops up during that time period.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 This is a cool book.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 The image to the right is a dimensional entity

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 he called Lamb.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 There it is right there.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Crowley did ceremonies

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 involving the drinking of blood.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 The drinking of blood from goats

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 and sacrifice.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Almost another world, right?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 On the other side of this one.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 You know, on your computer you've got the world.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 If you create a digital world

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 and if you hit the show code key

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 a whole other world appears

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 that was playing games

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 and manipulating that world, right?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 The world running your world.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Let's keep going.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 This is a being he believed

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 would step right out of thin air.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Crowley is famously quoted as saying

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 today they call them angels and demons.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Tomorrow they will call them something else.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 That's a famous quote by Aleister Crowley

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 on this being here.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Now, I'd like to go one step further with that.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Lamb, the alien looking character above

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 was claimed by Crowley

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 to travel with another entity

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 he claimed was called Ayawas.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Ayawas was said to be

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 a dimensional ancient Assyrian king

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 that Crowley described as

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 the face of a savage king

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 and eyes veiled lest their gaze

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 should destroy what they saw.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 My, Crowley's personal angel

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 an ancient Assyrian Babylonian

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Sumerian king.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Isn't that fascinating?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Well, that takes us right over here

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 to Marduk

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 which I believe was Mardan

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Nimrod's wicked son.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 It was actually a state from

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 that's actually it was Mardan

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 from who the statement comes

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 from the wicked comes wickedness.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 And there he is with his pet dragon

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 and all of his imagery.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 There's always a reptilian characteristic

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 to the occult.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 That doesn't mean that liking snakes is bad.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 It just means that they do that.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 They also like that they love the crow

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 the falcon, the raven, the dark crow.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 They love the crow.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 So if we look over here

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 at the entrance of the Enki

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 which is what we found.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So the even the ancient Sumerians

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 in their documents

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 they were heavily focused

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 heavily focused

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 because they knew about

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 they not only knew

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 they were practicing.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 The most prized thing

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 was the idea

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 that you could birth into reality

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 a child from one of these demonic beings.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 That's what their documents

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 are telling you.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 That's what's happening in Genesis 6.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 That's certainly what was happening

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 in Enoch 6.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 And that's what your

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 your pagan texts were highly

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 highly favoring.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Now, so one of the characters

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 who was very very prized

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 in Sumerian texts

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 would of course be the Enki

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 the Lord of the Earth.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Lord of the Earth.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Enki is a being summons

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 the water wiggly lines

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 represent the abzu

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 or the underworld.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Enki's raven is at his side.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 The witch hat is really the symbol

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 for the false tree of life.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Now, over here we deal with

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 the fall of the angels.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 So the Enki

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 and we're going to learn about

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 a new character here

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 that they were worshipping.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Enki comes forth

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 from a creature called Tiamat.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 This is a serpent.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 A wisdom serpent.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Who is in the feminine.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Now, you're going to find

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 this great mother goddess

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 and all of these

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 particularly in sex magic

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 practice rituals

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 where there's

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 where there's sacrifices involved.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Notice that.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Tiamat comes in the feminine

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 in the form of the god of chaos

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 and also the form of the dragon.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 You're going to find dragons.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 This reptilian cold bloodedness

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 is very critical to the occult.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 That is its origin.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 All these symbols

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 represent its origin.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Enki is summoned

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 often by Enmerkar.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 That's Nimrod

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 in the ancient text.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 The Sumerian text

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 following the flood.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 Here's the Vatican's

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Here is the Vatican's

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 serpent shaped cathedral.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 It's shaped exactly

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 like the Tiamat.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Here is a depiction

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 from Sumeria

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 of the Tiamat.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 An ancient creator god

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 according to Sumerians.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 It is a feminine.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 A goddess.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Mother goddess.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Seductive serpent

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 is what she is.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 There she is.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 And the Enki

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 seen here

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 or right down here

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 here is

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 so at the base

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 where the Pope stands

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 there's a little Pope down there

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 and there he stands

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 with this thing

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 coming out of the abyss

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 the abzu.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 See the wiggly lines

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 all around it?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And this contorted thing

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 this contorted demonic thing

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 coming loose.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 That doesn't make all...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 We've all got demonic stuff

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 in us.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Serpents in our life.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 But that's what

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 that's a depiction of

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 whether they know it or not.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 The occult is believed

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 since the beginning

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 that demonic entities

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 are real.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And that they can manifest.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Now let me tell you

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 one other thing about

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 these entities right here

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 at the bottom of the page.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 These entities

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 these entities

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 that these people are going to

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 for advice

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 some of it probably

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 for how they write

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 world policy

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 and other things

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 for their little companies.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 The only purpose

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 in this place

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 this place is a test.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 You're living in a test.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 It's all about

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 which tree you choose.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 These entities

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 not only hate you

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 and the fact

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 the demons means wisdom

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 they're smarter than you.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 You're not going to

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 outsmart them.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 The reason you're told

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 not to deal with them

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 is because they will win.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 There are no deals

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 between devils and men.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 None.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 You will lose that deal

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 and they will come out

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 on their podiums

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 looking like that

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 and laughing.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 We got you man.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Once you hit that

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 little Shokut Kokid

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 on reality

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 you see those little guys

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 coming out on the podium

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 are you falling downwards?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Game over.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 These entities

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 not only hate you

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 they wish they could be you.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 That's why they hate you

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 that much.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Here's the Enki

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 over here.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Speaking of things

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 coming out of thin air

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 and it's just one set

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 of two pages

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 of this book by the way.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Stepping through a portal

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 of the abyss

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 with the crow

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 notice he's wearing

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 he's got the crow there.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 These are all

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 the witches symbols

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 of today

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 even at Halloween.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 You got the witch

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 with the magic brew

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 with the frogs popping out.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 All these symbols

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 come from the ancient pagan world.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 He's stepping through

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 the Ebzu

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 with the little fishes in there.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 He's got the

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 that's the illusory

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 tree of life on his head

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 is what that symbol

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 is meant to represent.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 It's also where you get

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 the witch's hat

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 of this modern age.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 The crow the raven

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 is not only highly regarded

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 by the occult today

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 but is the bird

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 deified

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 made a god

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 by both the epic

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 of Gilgamesh

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 flood account

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 and the Eridu genesis.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Eridu is where

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 the Tower of Babel was.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 You have two birds

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 that were released.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 The epic of Gilgamesh

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 and the Sumerian texts

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 all glorify

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 the crow

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 the raven

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 the falcon.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 The Bible

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 glorifies the dove.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 Again

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 you're back

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 you're always back

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 to the two trees.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Choose to stay

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 who you serve.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Now if we look

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 at Job 1

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 okay so Noah

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 opened the door

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 and he sent out a raven

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 and it kept flying

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 to and fro.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 That's a direct quote

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 from Genesis 8.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Now if we read

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 to Job 1 6

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 it says

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 always notice the numbers

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 verse 6

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 the Beneha Elohim

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 that means the angels

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 came to present themselves

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 before the Lord

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 and Satan

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 was amongst them.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 And the Lord

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 said to Satan

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 the accuser of the brethren

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 where havest thou come?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And Satan

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 answered the Lord

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 from roaming

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 the earth

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 and from going

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 to and fro

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 in it.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Just like the dark crow.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 We're going to close there

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 the representative

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 of the crow.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 These are

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 and we're going to

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 go over some more

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 of this stuff

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 including the signs

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 and the heavens

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 and all of this

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 what the occult

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I believe it's important

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 for you to understand

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 what the occult believes.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 The history

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 has always been the same

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 between the Torah

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 or the Bible

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 and the occult.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 They're the same.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 And when you say demonic

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 you're really saying

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 man based.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 So when you're saying

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 the doctrines of devils

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 you're really saying

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 the doctors of men.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 You have the Lord

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 and you have the doctrines

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 of men

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 the doctrines of devils.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 When Jesus stood out there

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 on the ship

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 and he was actually

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 the disciples

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 were terrified.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Just like many

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 are terrified right now

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 in these hours.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 And the ship was rocking

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 and they thought

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 oh it's going to go down

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 every sign says

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 it's going to go down

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 and where does it say Jesus was?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 He was asleep

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 in the bottom of the boat.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 They only came and got him

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 when they needed him.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 When it looked desperate.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 What did he say?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 He said we're dying man.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 They've got Jesus on the boat.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 They've seen all these miracles

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 just like the Hebrews did

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 in the Exodus.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 The waters are parted

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 and they're out there

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 making a cow.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 We're dying.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 We're going to die.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 We're all going to die.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 That's the guy

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 that's been raising people

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 from the dead.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Oh ye of little faith.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Then he walks out there

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 in the bow of the boat.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 It says the winds

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 and the waves.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 The winds always represent

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 the doctrines.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 All words have a literal

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 and a symbolic meaning.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 All words.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Particularly in the Bible.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 The winds represent

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 the doctrines of men.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 The doctrines of devils.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 The winds were violent.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 And the waves.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Waves represent the oceans.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 And Jesus walked

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 to the bow of the boat.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 The front head of the boat.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And he said

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 peace be still.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And both obeyed him.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 I speak right now

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 in this video.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 You're not there.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 You're not to the end time

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 part of this story yet.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 The end time revolves

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 around Israel.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 You're not there yet.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 You're what has always

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 been in the world.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 The Lord's about to bring

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 some things that he's

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 been talking about

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 since the beginning

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 of the book.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Together like a perfect glove.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And the Lord God said

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 the man has now

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 become one of us.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 That's because

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 what you're looking at

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 in the opening of Genesis

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 is that God's being

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 represented in a triplicate.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Triplicate.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 I'll explain that more

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 in detail as well.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 He must not be allowed

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 to reach out his hand

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 and take from the tree of life

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 eat and live forever.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Be bound to sin.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 The nekosh.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 The arom.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Forever.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 So the Lord God

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 banished him from the garden

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 of Eden

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 to work the ground

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 from which he had been taken.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 And after he drove

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 the man out

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 he placed

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 on the east side

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 of the garden

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 of Eden

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 cherubim

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 and a flaming sword.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 The sword.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 The sword is the Bible.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 The sword is the truth.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 The flesh this way and that.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 This way and back and forth.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 To guard the way

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 to the tree of life.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Jesus said

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 so the sword is the truth, right?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 To guard the way

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 to the tree of life.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 The way to the tree of life.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 What did Jesus always say?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 I am the way

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 the truth

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 and the life.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 No man cometh before the Father

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 goes to that tree of life

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 but by me

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Jesus Christ.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 We're going to stop there

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 on that version

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 of walking through these.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 I'm going to have

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 I'm going to take you through

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 the Tiamat

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 and the snake

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 as it makes its way

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 through history

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 as we continue

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 in the partner section

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 at GodInANutshell.com

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 God bless

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 every last one of you

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 and your families

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 on the other side

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 of the screen.
