And since so much deals with the occult, it's important to understand the history behind some of the occult. Jesus said to be wise as serpents, but gentle as doves. So when we look at the occult, we probably ought to start in at some of the basic elements of it in your modern age. And the hero of modern occultism, or one of them, would be, of course, Aleister Crowley, seen here with the eye on top of his head, the pyramid eye on top of his head. And that symbol right there, it's only really appropriate that that symbol begin to take its rise again as you lead towards the end.
        Copy



That symbol is the 70. Images of that rotating thing captured by U.S. Navy aircraft, sensors locking in on the target. Commander David Fravor saw it firsthand during a training mission, describing it like a 40-foot-long tic-tac. This entity called Lamb, he claimed would physically manifest in the midst of some of these rituals. It is also believed to be the first drawing in modern history of what today is called a gray alien. That's kind of interesting, isn't it?

This is a story that starts with a snake. This show has closely followed the possibility there could be unknown entities in the skies above us. I believe that, but could they be even closer than that, right here? A new Wall Street Journal report profiles the many parents who think they can see ghosts, specters, and mysterious movements on their advanced baby monitors. Well, the UFO phenomenon, it was always there.
        Copy



Oh, man, it's breaking our physics. Maneuvering rapidly and changing direction. And as we both looked out the right side of our airplane, we saw a disturbance in the water and a white object, oblong, pointing north. The object was first sighted in 2004, then similar objects again in 2015. But, I mean, the objects were always, I mean, the whole UFO phenomenon would just appear and then disappear. So the question becomes, where's it when you don't see it? And there's so many of them, man. People catch these on their cell phones everywhere.
        Copy



It sounds like it's not coming from other planets. It's almost like it's a more localized phenomenon. Do that which is coming, as it were, indeed, know you what entities that are in arrow ships? What call them? Aliens. Ah, but they are not aliens. ETs. ETs. Extraterrestrial. Indeed.
        Copy



Humanity. That which is called they will become very much a part, as it were, indeed, of your plane. There's a whole fleet of them. Look on the ASA. My gosh. They're all going against the wind. The wind's 120 miles from the west. A whole thing, dude. This was extremely abrupt, like a ping-pong ball bouncing off a wall.
        Copy



The ability to hover over the water and then start a vertical climb from basically zero up towards about 12,000 feet and then accelerate in less than two seconds and disappear is something I had never seen in my life. Now, over here, just like we have the Enki being summoned at the Tower of Babel who steps forth from another reality to see Nimrod. Do you know any Nimrods in your world?
        Copy



Well, and Aleister Crowley, the same with his pyramid up here, stated this character—this alien-looking thing—would step through from another dimension, accompanied by this Sumerian-Assyrian-ancient Kang. Isn't that interesting? That means a baby is there. Some parents describe blurry humanoid figures. Others say they see floating white orbs.

Brett Larson is a host for Fox News Headlines 24-7. He joins us. What's the deal? It's an interesting one, right? As more of us put cameras in our homes, we're catching some unusual events, and some think... Well, if I look over here, here's Manly P. Hall, a 33rd-degree Freemason.
        Copy



Black magician Elias Levy—that's him up here—is depicted pictured above using a grimoire. That's a book of ritual magic. He has opened a portal to the dark world right there to summon an ancient wisdom demon called a Yoda. So that's what stepped through.
        Copy



So the circle he's got under him with the pentagrams and all of this—he's created another pentagram over there where he will summon the Yoda that will come through. I don't know how in the Star Wars films you could ever copyright the Yoda because I see Yoda dolls everywhere and I'm assuming that Star Wars believes it owns those.
        Copy



I don't know how possibly you could copyright that since it's really just hijacking stuff from Manly P. Hall who was hijacking stuff previously from Elias Levy. And this could be considered fairly modern occult because occult goes all the way back to the serpent at the beginning.

So we're taking a journey into the dimensions. So here's our little snake guy. Now, the word serpent there is actually going to be Nakosh—the Nakosh that was in the garden.
        Copy



Just as there were two trees in the garden we're going to find that history also has two paths—a choice. Look up Trey Smith's Choice—that's a video that a lot of people—it's buried—a lot of my stuff gets buried now on the internet. It used to not be but you've got to search for it by name now.
        Copy



Trey Smith's Choice—you'll find a set of three videos coincidentally that you may just like when you finish this.
        Copy



I pray the blood of Jesus and a protection over everything that you're about to watch in this video as we go through some of the history of the occult and all of the books—the materials that I'm reading out of are available over at GodInANutShell.com
        Copy



Now the serpent was more crafty—crafty witchy witchy. Arum is the word there—Arum than any of the other beasts of the field that the Lord God had made.
        Copy



And when they ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil—the word for naked right afterwards is arum—man had just taken on a property of the serpent.
        Copy



The occult—all of the demons and devils and all of that are really good guys. In the Torah, in the Bible—they're bad guys. In fact—the word demon means wise means wise is what it means.
        Copy



Now I'm going to skip you forward—I'm going to skip you forward to right over here—we're going to come into the book of Nimrod because this is where our occult gets deep and thick.
        Copy



The iron is a powerful symbol for God but is copied by—the demonic—the iron as with—the aleph—the aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet—it's the silent letter letter that starts everything yet it's silent—it's hidden—it's there but it's not there yet it starts everything—the iron is like that letter—it is silent letter—the iron is said to see but it does not speak—it represents—the light of God from Genesis 1-3
        Copy



However—in Matthew 6—22-23—it states if—the eye be—the evil eye if—the eye be—the evil eye—the iron ra is what that's called—the evil eye then how great is that darkness?
        Copy



Now Alistair Crowley seen over here—and this is a role model for—lot of these modern day witchy groups—and lot of these modern day witchy groups—they have lot—of prophecies—of their own—and this is something if you're—in one—of those groups what I might consider—how many times—in—the past when—you've been—in your group—and—it doesn't matter whether—you're—a billionaire or—whether—you’re—a guy—that just entered—and doesn’t know nothing about-it-how many-times-have—their models-on stuff been-wrong?
