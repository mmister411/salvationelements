0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.000,4.0, I can tell you that the occult people all believe stuff can step right out of thin air.
1,00:00:04.000,00:00:06.000,2.0, That's what they write in all the documents.
2,00:00:06.000,00:00:09.000,3.0," I mean, no good occultist doesn't believe... I mean, you're not a very good occultist."
3,00:00:09.000,00:00:11.000,2.0," You can't get that to happen, I guess."
4,00:00:11.000,00:00:13.000,2.0, I wouldn't be impressed with you.
5,00:00:13.000,00:00:17.000,4.0," And since so much deals with the occult,"
6,00:00:17.000,00:00:23.000,6.0, it's important to understand the history behind some of the occult.
7,00:00:23.000,00:00:29.000,6.0," Jesus said to be wise as serpents, but gentle as doves."
8,00:00:29.000,00:00:33.000,4.0," So when we look at occult, we probably ought to start in"
9,00:00:33.000,00:00:37.000,4.0, at some of the basic elements of it in your modern age.
10,00:00:37.000,00:00:41.000,4.0," And the hero of modern occultism, or one of them,"
11,00:00:41.000,00:00:45.000,4.0," would be, of course, Aleister Crowley, seen here with the eye on top of his head,"
12,00:00:45.000,00:00:48.000,3.0, the pyramid eye on top of his head.
13,00:00:48.000,00:00:51.000,3.0," And that symbol right there, it's only really appropriate"
14,00:00:51.000,00:00:55.000,4.0, that that symbol begin to take its rise again as you lead towards the end.
15,00:00:55.000,00:00:57.000,2.0, That symbol is the 70.
16,00:00:57.000,00:01:01.000,4.0," Images of that rotating thing captured by U.S. Navy aircraft,"
17,00:01:01.000,00:01:04.000,3.0, sensors locking in on the target.
18,00:01:04.000,00:01:08.000,4.0," Commander David Fravor saw it firsthand during a training mission,"
19,00:01:08.000,00:01:11.000,3.0, describing it like a 40-foot-long tic-tac.
20,00:01:11.000,00:01:15.000,4.0," This entity called Lamb, he claimed would physically manifest"
21,00:01:15.000,00:01:18.000,3.0, in the midst of some of these rituals.
22,00:01:18.000,00:01:22.000,4.0, It is also believed to be the first drawing in modern history
23,00:01:22.000,00:01:25.000,3.0, of what today is called a gray alien.
24,00:01:25.000,00:01:27.000,2.0," That's kind of interesting, isn't it?"
25,00:01:27.000,00:01:30.000,3.0, This is a story that starts with a snake.
26,00:01:30.000,00:01:33.000,3.0, This show has closely followed the possibility there could be
27,00:01:33.000,00:01:36.000,3.0," unknown entities in the skies above us, I believe that,"
28,00:01:36.000,00:01:39.000,3.0," but could they be even closer than that, right here?"
29,00:01:39.000,00:01:42.000,3.0, A new Wall Street Journal report profiles the many parents
30,00:01:42.000,00:01:45.000,3.0," who think they can see ghosts, specters, and mysterious movements"
31,00:01:45.000,00:01:48.000,3.0, on their advanced baby monitors.
32,00:01:48.000,00:01:50.000,2.0," Well, the UFO phenomenon, it was always there."
33,00:01:50.000,00:01:52.000,2.0," Oh, man, it's breaking our physics."
34,00:01:52.000,00:01:55.000,3.0, Maneuvering rapidly and changing direction.
35,00:01:55.000,00:01:58.000,3.0," And as we both looked out the right side of our airplane,"
36,00:01:58.000,00:02:01.000,3.0," we saw a disturbance in the water and a white object,"
37,00:02:01.000,00:02:03.000,2.0," oblong, pointing north."
38,00:02:03.000,00:02:06.000,3.0," The object was first sighted in 2004,"
39,00:02:06.000,00:02:09.000,3.0, then similar objects again in 2015.
40,00:02:09.000,00:02:13.000,4.0," But, I mean, the objects were always, I mean, the whole UFO phenomenon"
41,00:02:13.000,00:02:15.000,2.0, would just appear and then disappear.
42,00:02:15.000,00:02:17.000,2.0," So the question becomes, where's it when you don't see it?"
43,00:02:17.000,00:02:19.000,2.0," And there's so many of them, man."
44,00:02:19.000,00:02:21.000,2.0, People catch these on their cell phones everywhere.
45,00:02:21.000,00:02:23.000,2.0, It sounds like it's not coming from other planets.
46,00:02:23.000,00:02:26.000,3.0, It's almost like it's a more localized phenomenon.
47,00:02:26.000,00:02:28.000,2.0," Do that which is coming, as it were, indeed,"
48,00:02:28.000,00:02:34.000,6.0, know you what entities that are in arrow ships?
49,00:02:34.000,00:02:35.000,1.0, What call them?
50,00:02:35.000,00:02:37.000,2.0, Aliens.
51,00:02:37.000,00:02:39.000,2.0," Ah, but they are not aliens."
52,00:02:39.000,00:02:41.000,2.0, ETs.
53,00:02:41.000,00:02:42.000,1.0, ETs.
54,00:02:42.000,00:02:43.000,1.0, Extraterrestrial.
55,00:02:43.000,00:02:45.000,2.0, Indeed.
56,00:02:45.000,00:02:47.000,2.0, Humanity.
57,00:02:47.000,00:02:51.000,4.0," That which is called they will become very much a part,"
58,00:02:51.000,00:02:53.000,2.0," as it were, indeed, of your plane."
59,00:02:53.000,00:02:54.000,1.0, There's a whole fleet of them.
60,00:02:54.000,00:02:56.000,2.0, Look on the ASA.
61,00:02:56.000,00:02:58.000,2.0, My gosh.
62,00:02:58.000,00:03:00.000,2.0, They're all going against the wind.
63,00:03:00.000,00:03:02.000,2.0, The wind's 120 miles from the west.
64,00:03:02.000,00:03:04.000,2.0," A whole thing, dude."
65,00:03:04.000,00:03:07.000,3.0," This was extremely abrupt, like a ping-pong ball bouncing off a wall."
66,00:03:07.000,00:03:10.000,3.0, The ability to hover over the water and then start a vertical climb
67,00:03:10.000,00:03:13.000,3.0," from basically zero up towards about 12,000 feet"
68,00:03:13.000,00:03:15.000,2.0, and then accelerate in less than two seconds and disappear
69,00:03:15.000,00:03:18.000,3.0, is something I had never seen in my life.
70,00:03:18.000,00:03:22.000,4.0," Now, over here, just like we have the Enki being summonsed"
71,00:03:22.000,00:03:25.000,3.0," at the Tower of Babel, who steps forth from another reality"
72,00:03:25.000,00:03:27.000,2.0, to see Nimrod.
73,00:03:27.000,00:03:30.000,3.0, Do you know any Nimrods in your world?
74,00:03:30.000,00:03:34.000,4.0," Well, and Aleister Crowley, the same with his pyramid up here,"
75,00:03:34.000,00:03:38.000,4.0," stated this character, this alien-looking thing,"
76,00:03:38.000,00:03:41.000,3.0," would step through from another dimension,"
77,00:03:41.000,00:03:46.000,5.0," accompanied by this Sumerian, Assyrian, ancient Kang."
78,00:03:46.000,00:03:48.000,2.0, Isn't that interesting?
79,00:03:48.000,00:03:50.000,2.0, That means a baby is there.
80,00:03:50.000,00:03:52.000,2.0, Some parents describe blurry humanoid figures.
81,00:03:52.000,00:03:54.000,2.0, Others say they see floating white orbs.
82,00:03:54.000,00:03:58.000,4.0, Brett Larson is a host for Fox News Headlines 24-7.
83,00:03:58.000,00:04:00.000,2.0, He joins us. What's the deal?
84,00:04:00.000,00:04:01.000,1.0," It's an interesting one, right?"
85,00:04:01.000,00:04:05.000,4.0," As more of us put cameras in our homes, we're catching some unusual events,"
86,00:04:05.000,00:04:09.000,4.0," and some think, well, if I look over here,"
87,00:04:09.000,00:04:14.000,5.0," here's Manly P. Hall, a 33rd-degree Freemason."
88,00:04:14.000,00:04:18.000,4.0," Black magician Elias Levy, that's him up here,"
89,00:04:18.000,00:04:22.000,4.0," is depicted, pictured above, using a grimoire."
90,00:04:22.000,00:04:25.000,3.0, That's a book of ritual magic.
91,00:04:25.000,00:04:30.000,5.0," He has opened a portal to the dark world, right there,"
92,00:04:30.000,00:04:36.000,6.0, to summons an ancient wisdom demon called a Yoda.
93,00:04:36.000,00:04:38.000,2.0, So that's what stepped through.
94,00:04:38.000,00:04:42.000,4.0," So the circle he's got under him, with the pentagrams and all of this,"
95,00:04:42.000,00:04:44.000,2.0," he's created another pentagram over there,"
96,00:04:44.000,00:04:48.000,4.0, where he will summons the Yoda that will come through.
97,00:04:48.000,00:04:54.000,6.0," I don't know how in the Star Wars films you could ever copyright the Yoda,"
98,00:04:54.000,00:04:56.000,2.0," because I see Yoda dolls everywhere,"
99,00:04:56.000,00:04:59.000,3.0, and I'm assuming that Star Wars believes it owns those.
100,00:04:59.000,00:05:02.000,3.0," I don't know how possibly you could copyright that,"
101,00:05:02.000,00:05:07.000,5.0," since it's really just hijacking stuff from Manly P. Hall,"
102,00:05:07.000,00:05:11.000,4.0, who was hijacking stuff previously from Elias Levy.
103,00:05:11.000,00:05:15.000,4.0," And this could be considered fairly modern occult,"
104,00:05:15.000,00:05:21.000,6.0, because occult goes all the way back to the serpent at the beginning.
105,00:05:21.000,00:05:26.000,5.0, So we're taking a journey into the dimensions.
106,00:05:26.000,00:05:28.000,2.0, So here's our little snake guy.
107,00:05:28.000,00:05:31.000,3.0," Now, the word serpent there is actually going to be Nakosh,"
108,00:05:31.000,00:05:35.000,4.0, the Nakosh that was in the garden.
109,00:05:35.000,00:05:37.000,2.0," Just as there were two trees in the garden,"
110,00:05:37.000,00:05:41.000,4.0," we're going to find that history also has two paths, a choice."
111,00:05:41.000,00:05:43.000,2.0, Look up Trey Smith's Choice.
112,00:05:43.000,00:05:45.000,2.0," That's a video that a lot of people, it's buried,"
113,00:05:45.000,00:05:47.000,2.0, a lot of my stuff gets buried now on the internet.
114,00:05:47.000,00:05:50.000,3.0," It used to not be, but you've got to search for it by name now."
115,00:05:50.000,00:05:52.000,2.0, Trey Smith's Choice.
116,00:05:52.000,00:05:54.000,2.0," You'll find a set of three videos, coincidentally,"
117,00:05:54.000,00:05:57.000,3.0, that you may just like when you finish this.
118,00:05:57.000,00:06:00.000,3.0, I pray the blood of Jesus and a protection
119,00:06:00.000,00:06:03.000,3.0, over everything that you're about to watch in this video.
120,00:06:03.000,00:06:06.000,3.0, As we go through some of the history of the occult
121,00:06:06.000,00:06:10.000,4.0," and all of the books, the materials that I'm reading out of"
122,00:06:10.000,00:06:14.000,4.0, are available over at GodInANutShell.com
123,00:06:14.000,00:06:20.000,6.0," Now the serpent was more crafty, crafty, witchy, witchy."
124,00:06:20.000,00:06:22.000,2.0, Arum is the word there.
125,00:06:22.000,00:06:23.000,1.0, Arum.
126,00:06:23.000,00:06:26.000,3.0, Arum than any of the other beasts of the field
127,00:06:26.000,00:06:28.000,2.0, that the Lord God had made.
128,00:06:28.000,00:06:33.000,5.0," And when they ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,"
129,00:06:33.000,00:06:38.000,5.0, the word for naked right afterwards is arum.
130,00:06:38.000,00:06:43.000,5.0, Man had just taken on a property of the serpent.
131,00:06:43.000,00:06:46.000,3.0," The occult, all of the demons and devils and all of that"
132,00:06:46.000,00:06:48.000,2.0, are really good guys.
133,00:06:48.000,00:06:53.000,5.0," In the Torah, in the Bible, they're bad guys."
134,00:06:53.000,00:06:56.000,3.0," In fact, the word demon means wise."
135,00:06:56.000,00:06:58.000,2.0, Means wise is what it means.
136,00:06:58.000,00:07:02.000,4.0, Now I'm going to skip you forward.
137,00:07:02.000,00:07:04.000,2.0, I'm going to skip you forward to right over here.
138,00:07:04.000,00:07:06.000,2.0, We're going to come into the book of Nimrod
139,00:07:06.000,00:07:11.000,5.0, because this is where our occult gets deep and thick.
140,00:07:11.000,00:07:14.000,3.0," The iron is a powerful symbol for God,"
141,00:07:14.000,00:07:17.000,3.0, but is copied by the demonic.
142,00:07:17.000,00:07:20.000,3.0," The iron, as with the aleph."
143,00:07:20.000,00:07:24.000,4.0, The aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
144,00:07:24.000,00:07:26.000,2.0, It's the silent letter.
145,00:07:26.000,00:07:28.000,2.0," Letter that starts everything, yet it's silent."
146,00:07:28.000,00:07:29.000,1.0, It's hidden.
147,00:07:29.000,00:07:32.000,3.0," It's there, but it's not there, yet it starts everything."
148,00:07:32.000,00:07:35.000,3.0, The iron is like that letter.
149,00:07:35.000,00:07:36.000,1.0, It is silent letter.
150,00:07:36.000,00:07:44.000,8.0," The iron is said to see, but it does not speak."
151,00:07:44.000,00:07:49.000,5.0, It represents the light of God from Genesis 1-3.
152,00:07:49.000,00:07:54.000,5.0," However, in Matthew 6, 22-23, it states,"
153,00:07:54.000,00:07:58.000,4.0," if the eye be the evil eye, if the eye be the evil eye,"
154,00:07:58.000,00:08:00.000,2.0, the iron ra is what that's called.
155,00:08:00.000,00:08:02.000,2.0, The evil eye.
156,00:08:02.000,00:08:05.000,3.0, Then how great is that darkness?
157,00:08:05.000,00:08:07.000,2.0," Now Alistair Crowley, seen over here,"
158,00:08:07.000,00:08:09.000,2.0, and this is a role model for a lot of these
159,00:08:09.000,00:08:12.000,3.0, modern day witchy groups.
160,00:08:12.000,00:08:13.000,1.0," And a lot of these modern day witchy groups,"
161,00:08:13.000,00:08:15.000,2.0, they have a lot of prophecies of their own.
162,00:08:15.000,00:08:17.000,2.0," And this is something, if you're in one of those groups,"
163,00:08:17.000,00:08:20.000,3.0," what I might consider is how many times in the past,"
164,00:08:20.000,00:08:21.000,1.0," when you've been in your group,"
165,00:08:21.000,00:08:22.000,1.0, and it doesn't matter whether you're a billionaire
166,00:08:22.000,00:08:23.000,1.0, or whether you're a guy that just entered
167,00:08:23.000,00:08:25.000,2.0, and doesn't know nothing about it.
168,00:08:25.000,00:08:29.000,4.0, How many times have their models on stuff been wrong?
169,00:08:29.000,00:08:31.000,2.0, Just a question.
170,00:08:31.000,00:08:33.000,2.0, There's something wrong with the prophecies.
171,00:08:33.000,00:08:34.000,1.0, There's something wrong with the things
172,00:08:34.000,00:08:35.000,1.0, speaking on the other side
173,00:08:35.000,00:08:38.000,3.0," if you can't get stuff right all the time, huh?"
174,00:08:38.000,00:08:40.000,2.0, I'm banking it fails you hard in the end.
175,00:08:40.000,00:08:42.000,2.0," These are the same little guys, by the way."
176,00:08:42.000,00:08:45.000,3.0, This is the same stuff that people describe
177,00:08:45.000,00:08:47.000,2.0, in going to hell experiences.
178,00:08:47.000,00:08:48.000,1.0, And I've listened to lots and lots
179,00:08:48.000,00:08:50.000,2.0, and lots of those over time.
180,00:08:50.000,00:08:51.000,1.0, These are the things that oftentimes
181,00:08:51.000,00:08:53.000,2.0," those hell experiences, right?"
182,00:08:53.000,00:08:54.000,1.0," When they die, they're conscious,"
183,00:08:54.000,00:08:55.000,1.0," they're looking around,"
184,00:08:55.000,00:08:56.000,1.0," and before they go downward,"
185,00:08:56.000,00:09:00.000,4.0," like a tractor beam takes them down, right?"
186,00:09:00.000,00:09:02.000,2.0, It's ugly.
187,00:09:02.000,00:09:03.000,1.0," Oh, it shakes them."
188,00:09:03.000,00:09:05.000,2.0, If they...
189,00:09:05.000,00:09:06.000,1.0," These little dudes come out on a podium,"
190,00:09:06.000,00:09:08.000,2.0, except they're uglier than that.
191,00:09:08.000,00:09:09.000,1.0, And they're laughing at you.
192,00:09:09.000,00:09:11.000,2.0," Anyhow, we'll continue."
193,00:09:11.000,00:09:14.000,3.0, This was one of Crowley's guides.
194,00:09:14.000,00:09:15.000,1.0, He called it Lamb.
195,00:09:15.000,00:09:17.000,2.0, Isn't that priceless?
196,00:09:17.000,00:09:20.000,3.0, Crowley is likely the most famous occultist
197,00:09:20.000,00:09:21.000,1.0," in modern history,"
198,00:09:21.000,00:09:24.000,3.0, living from 1875 to 1947.
199,00:09:24.000,00:09:26.000,2.0," Now, that's the year the aliens crashed in Roswell,"
200,00:09:26.000,00:09:28.000,2.0, isn't it?
201,00:09:28.000,00:09:32.000,4.0, It's also the same year that
202,00:09:32.000,00:09:34.000,2.0, that Israel became a nation.
203,00:09:34.000,00:09:35.000,1.0, Isn't that funny?
204,00:09:35.000,00:09:36.000,1.0," You're 70 years from all of that,"
205,00:09:36.000,00:09:38.000,2.0, right here on this page.
206,00:09:38.000,00:09:41.000,3.0, It is the symbol one would expect to find
207,00:09:41.000,00:09:44.000,3.0, leading towards the end times.
208,00:09:44.000,00:09:46.000,2.0," So, the end times."
209,00:09:46.000,00:09:47.000,1.0, The ayin.
210,00:09:47.000,00:09:49.000,2.0, It's a symbol you'd expect to appear.
211,00:09:49.000,00:09:50.000,1.0, It means 70.
212,00:09:50.000,00:09:52.000,2.0, Israel just had their 70th anniversary.
213,00:09:52.000,00:09:53.000,1.0, I was at it.
214,00:09:53.000,00:09:57.000,4.0," The CCP, the Chinese Communist Party government"
215,00:09:57.000,00:09:58.000,1.0, just celebrated their...
216,00:09:58.000,00:10:02.000,4.0, You've got a lot of 70s popping up.
217,00:10:02.000,00:10:05.000,3.0, 70 there.
218,00:10:05.000,00:10:09.000,4.0, And also the symbol for Daniel's 70th week.
219,00:10:09.000,00:10:12.000,3.0," So, your entire revelation in times"
220,00:10:12.000,00:10:14.000,2.0, with the Antichrist and all of this
221,00:10:14.000,00:10:17.000,3.0, occurs in what's known as Daniel's 70th week.
222,00:10:17.000,00:10:18.000,1.0," So, it should be appropriate"
223,00:10:18.000,00:10:20.000,2.0, that that ayin pops up during that time period.
224,00:10:20.000,00:10:22.000,2.0, This is a cool book.
225,00:10:22.000,00:10:24.000,2.0, The image to the right is a dimensional entity
226,00:10:24.000,00:10:25.000,1.0, he called Lamb.
227,00:10:25.000,00:10:26.000,1.0, There it is right there.
228,00:10:26.000,00:10:28.000,2.0, Crowley did ceremonies
229,00:10:28.000,00:10:30.000,2.0, involving the drinking of blood.
230,00:10:30.000,00:10:33.000,3.0, The drinking of blood from goats
231,00:10:33.000,00:10:35.000,2.0, and sacrifice.
232,00:10:35.000,00:10:36.000,1.0," Almost another world, right?"
233,00:10:36.000,00:10:38.000,2.0, On the other side of this one.
234,00:10:38.000,00:10:41.000,3.0," You know, on your computer you've got the world."
235,00:10:41.000,00:10:42.000,1.0, If you create a digital world
236,00:10:42.000,00:10:44.000,2.0, and if you hit the show code key
237,00:10:44.000,00:10:46.000,2.0, a whole other world appears
238,00:10:46.000,00:10:47.000,1.0, that was playing games
239,00:10:47.000,00:10:49.000,2.0," and manipulating that world, right?"
240,00:10:49.000,00:10:51.000,2.0, The world running your world.
241,00:10:51.000,00:10:53.000,2.0, Let's keep going.
242,00:10:53.000,00:10:54.000,1.0, This is a being he believed
243,00:10:54.000,00:10:56.000,2.0, would step right out of thin air.
244,00:10:56.000,00:10:58.000,2.0, Crowley is famously quoted as saying
245,00:10:58.000,00:11:00.000,2.0, today they call them angels and demons.
246,00:11:00.000,00:11:02.000,2.0, Tomorrow they will call them something else.
247,00:11:02.000,00:11:04.000,2.0, That's a famous quote by Aleister Crowley
248,00:11:04.000,00:11:05.000,1.0, on this being here.
249,00:11:05.000,00:11:07.000,2.0," Now, I'd like to go one step further with that."
250,00:11:07.000,00:11:10.000,3.0," Lamb, the alien looking character above"
251,00:11:10.000,00:11:12.000,2.0, was claimed by Crowley
252,00:11:12.000,00:11:14.000,2.0, to travel with another entity
253,00:11:14.000,00:11:16.000,2.0, he claimed was called Ayawas.
254,00:11:16.000,00:11:18.000,2.0, Ayawas was said to be
255,00:11:18.000,00:11:21.000,3.0, a dimensional ancient Assyrian king
256,00:11:21.000,00:11:23.000,2.0, that Crowley described as
257,00:11:23.000,00:11:25.000,2.0, the face of a savage king
258,00:11:25.000,00:11:27.000,2.0, and eyes veiled lest their gaze
259,00:11:27.000,00:11:29.000,2.0, should destroy what they saw.
260,00:11:29.000,00:11:31.000,2.0," My, Crowley's personal angel"
261,00:11:31.000,00:11:34.000,3.0, an ancient Assyrian Babylonian
262,00:11:34.000,00:11:35.000,1.0, Sumerian king.
263,00:11:35.000,00:11:36.000,1.0, Isn't that fascinating?
264,00:11:36.000,00:11:38.000,2.0," Well, that takes us right over here"
265,00:11:38.000,00:11:39.000,1.0, to Marduk
266,00:11:39.000,00:11:41.000,2.0, which I believe was Mardan
267,00:11:41.000,00:11:42.000,1.0, Nimrod's wicked son.
268,00:11:42.000,00:11:44.000,2.0, It was actually a state from
269,00:11:44.000,00:11:46.000,2.0, that's actually it was Mardan
270,00:11:46.000,00:11:47.000,1.0, from who the statement comes
271,00:11:47.000,00:11:50.000,3.0, from the wicked comes wickedness.
272,00:11:50.000,00:11:52.000,2.0, And there he is with his pet dragon
273,00:11:52.000,00:11:54.000,2.0, and all of his imagery.
274,00:11:54.000,00:11:57.000,3.0, There's always a reptilian characteristic
275,00:11:57.000,00:11:58.000,1.0, to the occult.
276,00:11:58.000,00:12:00.000,2.0, That doesn't mean that liking snakes is bad.
277,00:12:00.000,00:12:01.000,1.0, It just means that they do that.
278,00:12:01.000,00:12:03.000,2.0, They also like that they love the crow
279,00:12:03.000,00:12:06.000,3.0," the falcon, the raven, the dark crow."
280,00:12:06.000,00:12:08.000,2.0, They love the crow.
281,00:12:08.000,00:12:09.000,1.0, So if we look over here
282,00:12:09.000,00:12:11.000,2.0, at the entrance of the Enki
283,00:12:11.000,00:12:12.000,1.0, which is what we found.
284,00:12:12.000,00:12:15.000,3.0, So the even the ancient Sumerians
285,00:12:15.000,00:12:16.000,1.0, in their documents
286,00:12:16.000,00:12:18.000,2.0, they were heavily focused
287,00:12:18.000,00:12:19.000,1.0, heavily focused
288,00:12:19.000,00:12:20.000,1.0, because they knew about
289,00:12:20.000,00:12:21.000,1.0, they not only knew
290,00:12:21.000,00:12:22.000,1.0, they were practicing.
291,00:12:22.000,00:12:24.000,2.0, The most prized thing
292,00:12:24.000,00:12:25.000,1.0, was the idea
293,00:12:25.000,00:12:27.000,2.0, that you could birth into reality
294,00:12:27.000,00:12:29.000,2.0, a child from one of these demonic beings.
295,00:12:29.000,00:12:31.000,2.0, That's what their documents
296,00:12:31.000,00:12:32.000,1.0, are telling you.
297,00:12:32.000,00:12:34.000,2.0, That's what's happening in Genesis 6.
298,00:12:34.000,00:12:36.000,2.0, That's certainly what was happening
299,00:12:36.000,00:12:37.000,1.0, in Enoch 6.
300,00:12:37.000,00:12:38.000,1.0, And that's what your
301,00:12:38.000,00:12:40.000,2.0, your pagan texts were highly
302,00:12:40.000,00:12:42.000,2.0, highly favoring.
303,00:12:42.000,00:12:46.000,4.0," Now, so one of the characters"
304,00:12:46.000,00:12:48.000,2.0, who was very very prized
305,00:12:48.000,00:12:50.000,2.0, in Sumerian texts
306,00:12:50.000,00:12:52.000,2.0, would of course be the Enki
307,00:12:52.000,00:12:53.000,1.0, the Lord of the Earth.
308,00:12:53.000,00:12:54.000,1.0, Lord of the Earth.
309,00:12:54.000,00:12:56.000,2.0, Enki is a being summons
310,00:12:56.000,00:12:57.000,1.0, the water wiggly lines
311,00:12:57.000,00:12:58.000,1.0, represent the abzu
312,00:12:58.000,00:12:59.000,1.0, or the underworld.
313,00:12:59.000,00:13:01.000,2.0, Enki's raven is at his side.
314,00:13:01.000,00:13:02.000,1.0, The witch hat is really the symbol
315,00:13:02.000,00:13:04.000,2.0, for the false tree of life.
316,00:13:04.000,00:13:06.000,2.0," Now, over here we deal with"
317,00:13:06.000,00:13:07.000,1.0, the fall of the angels.
318,00:13:07.000,00:13:08.000,1.0, So the Enki
319,00:13:08.000,00:13:09.000,1.0, and we're going to learn about
320,00:13:09.000,00:13:10.000,1.0, a new character here
321,00:13:10.000,00:13:11.000,1.0, that they were worshipping.
322,00:13:11.000,00:13:12.000,1.0, Enki comes forth
323,00:13:12.000,00:13:14.000,2.0, from a creature called Tiamat.
324,00:13:14.000,00:13:15.000,1.0, This is a serpent.
325,00:13:15.000,00:13:17.000,2.0, A wisdom serpent.
326,00:13:17.000,00:13:19.000,2.0, Who is in the feminine.
327,00:13:19.000,00:13:20.000,1.0," Now, you're going to find"
328,00:13:20.000,00:13:21.000,1.0, this great mother goddess
329,00:13:21.000,00:13:22.000,1.0, and all of these
330,00:13:22.000,00:13:24.000,2.0, particularly in sex magic
331,00:13:24.000,00:13:25.000,1.0, practice rituals
332,00:13:25.000,00:13:26.000,1.0, where there's
333,00:13:26.000,00:13:28.000,2.0, where there's sacrifices involved.
334,00:13:28.000,00:13:30.000,2.0, Notice that.
335,00:13:30.000,00:13:32.000,2.0, Tiamat comes in the feminine
336,00:13:32.000,00:13:34.000,2.0, in the form of the god of chaos
337,00:13:34.000,00:13:36.000,2.0, and also the form of the dragon.
338,00:13:36.000,00:13:37.000,1.0, You're going to find dragons.
339,00:13:37.000,00:13:38.000,1.0, This reptilian cold bloodedness
340,00:13:38.000,00:13:40.000,2.0, is very critical to the occult.
341,00:13:40.000,00:13:42.000,2.0, That is its origin.
342,00:13:42.000,00:13:43.000,1.0, All these symbols
343,00:13:43.000,00:13:44.000,1.0, represent its origin.
344,00:13:44.000,00:13:45.000,1.0, Enki is summoned
345,00:13:45.000,00:13:46.000,1.0, often by Enmerkar.
346,00:13:46.000,00:13:47.000,1.0, That's Nimrod
347,00:13:47.000,00:13:48.000,1.0, in the ancient text.
348,00:13:48.000,00:13:49.000,1.0, The Sumerian text
349,00:13:49.000,00:13:50.000,1.0, following the flood.
350,00:13:50.000,00:13:52.000,2.0, Here's the Vatican's
351,00:13:52.000,00:13:54.000,2.0, Here is the Vatican's
352,00:13:54.000,00:13:56.000,2.0, serpent shaped cathedral.
353,00:13:56.000,00:13:57.000,1.0, It's shaped exactly
354,00:13:57.000,00:13:58.000,1.0, like the Tiamat.
355,00:13:58.000,00:14:00.000,2.0, Here is a depiction
356,00:14:00.000,00:14:01.000,1.0, from Sumeria
357,00:14:01.000,00:14:02.000,1.0, of the Tiamat.
358,00:14:02.000,00:14:03.000,1.0, An ancient creator god
359,00:14:03.000,00:14:04.000,1.0, according to Sumerians.
360,00:14:04.000,00:14:05.000,1.0, It is a feminine.
361,00:14:05.000,00:14:06.000,1.0, A goddess.
362,00:14:06.000,00:14:07.000,1.0, Mother goddess.
363,00:14:07.000,00:14:09.000,2.0, Seductive serpent
364,00:14:09.000,00:14:10.000,1.0, is what she is.
365,00:14:10.000,00:14:11.000,1.0, There she is.
366,00:14:11.000,00:14:12.000,1.0, And the Enki
367,00:14:12.000,00:14:13.000,1.0, seen here
368,00:14:13.000,00:14:14.000,1.0, or right down here
369,00:14:14.000,00:14:15.000,1.0, here is
370,00:14:15.000,00:14:16.000,1.0, so at the base
371,00:14:16.000,00:14:17.000,1.0, where the Pope stands
372,00:14:17.000,00:14:18.000,1.0, there's a little Pope down there
373,00:14:18.000,00:14:20.000,2.0, and there he stands
374,00:14:20.000,00:14:21.000,1.0, with this thing
375,00:14:21.000,00:14:22.000,1.0, coming out of the abyss
376,00:14:22.000,00:14:23.000,1.0, the abzu.
377,00:14:23.000,00:14:24.000,1.0, See the wiggly lines
378,00:14:24.000,00:14:25.000,1.0, all around it?
379,00:14:25.000,00:14:26.000,1.0, And this contorted thing
380,00:14:26.000,00:14:27.000,1.0, this contorted demonic thing
381,00:14:27.000,00:14:28.000,1.0, coming loose.
382,00:14:28.000,00:14:29.000,1.0, That doesn't make all...
383,00:14:29.000,00:14:31.000,2.0, We've all got demonic stuff
384,00:14:31.000,00:14:32.000,1.0, in us.
385,00:14:32.000,00:14:33.000,1.0, Serpents in our life.
386,00:14:33.000,00:14:34.000,1.0, But that's what
387,00:14:34.000,00:14:35.000,1.0, that's a depiction of
388,00:14:35.000,00:14:37.000,2.0, whether they know it or not.
389,00:14:37.000,00:14:39.000,2.0, The occult is believed
390,00:14:39.000,00:14:40.000,1.0, since the beginning
391,00:14:40.000,00:14:41.000,1.0, that demonic entities
392,00:14:41.000,00:14:42.000,1.0, are real.
393,00:14:42.000,00:14:44.000,2.0, And that they can manifest.
394,00:14:44.000,00:14:45.000,1.0, Now let me tell you
395,00:14:45.000,00:14:46.000,1.0, one other thing about
396,00:14:46.000,00:14:47.000,1.0, these entities right here
397,00:14:47.000,00:14:48.000,1.0, at the bottom of the page.
398,00:14:48.000,00:14:49.000,1.0, These entities
399,00:14:49.000,00:14:50.000,1.0, these entities
400,00:14:50.000,00:14:51.000,1.0, that these people are going to
401,00:14:51.000,00:14:52.000,1.0, for advice
402,00:14:52.000,00:14:53.000,1.0, some of it probably
403,00:14:53.000,00:14:54.000,1.0, for how they write
404,00:14:54.000,00:14:55.000,1.0, world policy
405,00:14:55.000,00:14:56.000,1.0, and other things
406,00:14:56.000,00:14:57.000,1.0, for their little companies.
407,00:14:57.000,00:14:58.000,1.0, The only purpose
408,00:14:58.000,00:14:59.000,1.0, in this place
409,00:14:59.000,00:15:00.000,1.0, this place is a test.
410,00:15:00.000,00:15:01.000,1.0, You're living in a test.
411,00:15:01.000,00:15:02.000,1.0, It's all about
412,00:15:02.000,00:15:03.000,1.0, which tree you choose.
413,00:15:03.000,00:15:04.000,1.0, These entities
414,00:15:04.000,00:15:05.000,1.0, not only hate you
415,00:15:05.000,00:15:06.000,1.0, and the fact
416,00:15:06.000,00:15:07.000,1.0, the demons means wisdom
417,00:15:07.000,00:15:08.000,1.0, they're smarter than you.
418,00:15:08.000,00:15:09.000,1.0, You're not going to
419,00:15:09.000,00:15:10.000,1.0, outsmart them.
420,00:15:10.000,00:15:11.000,1.0, The reason you're told
421,00:15:11.000,00:15:12.000,1.0, not to deal with them
422,00:15:12.000,00:15:13.000,1.0, is because they will win.
423,00:15:13.000,00:15:14.000,1.0, There are no deals
424,00:15:14.000,00:15:15.000,1.0, between devils and men.
425,00:15:15.000,00:15:16.000,1.0, None.
426,00:15:16.000,00:15:17.000,1.0, You will lose that deal
427,00:15:17.000,00:15:18.000,1.0, and they will come out
428,00:15:18.000,00:15:19.000,1.0, on their podiums
429,00:15:19.000,00:15:20.000,1.0, looking like that
430,00:15:20.000,00:15:21.000,1.0, and laughing.
431,00:15:21.000,00:15:22.000,1.0, We got you man.
432,00:15:22.000,00:15:23.000,1.0, Once you hit that
433,00:15:23.000,00:15:24.000,1.0, little Shokut Kokid
434,00:15:24.000,00:15:25.000,1.0, on reality
435,00:15:25.000,00:15:26.000,1.0, you see those little guys
436,00:15:26.000,00:15:27.000,1.0, coming out on the podium
437,00:15:27.000,00:15:28.000,1.0, are you falling downwards?
438,00:15:28.000,00:15:29.000,1.0, Game over.
439,00:15:29.000,00:15:30.000,1.0, These entities
440,00:15:30.000,00:15:31.000,1.0, not only hate you
441,00:15:31.000,00:15:32.000,1.0, they wish they could be you.
442,00:15:32.000,00:15:33.000,1.0, That's why they hate you
443,00:15:33.000,00:15:34.000,1.0, that much.
444,00:15:34.000,00:15:35.000,1.0, Here's the Enki
445,00:15:35.000,00:15:36.000,1.0, over here.
446,00:15:36.000,00:15:37.000,1.0, Speaking of things
447,00:15:37.000,00:15:38.000,1.0, coming out of thin air
448,00:15:38.000,00:15:39.000,1.0, and it's just one set
449,00:15:39.000,00:15:40.000,1.0, of two pages
450,00:15:40.000,00:15:41.000,1.0, of this book by the way.
451,00:15:41.000,00:15:42.000,1.0, Stepping through a portal
452,00:15:42.000,00:15:43.000,1.0, of the abyss
453,00:15:43.000,00:15:44.000,1.0, with the crow
454,00:15:44.000,00:15:45.000,1.0, notice he's wearing
455,00:15:45.000,00:15:46.000,1.0, he's got the crow there.
456,00:15:46.000,00:15:47.000,1.0, These are all
457,00:15:47.000,00:15:48.000,1.0, the witches symbols
458,00:15:48.000,00:15:49.000,1.0, of today
459,00:15:49.000,00:15:50.000,1.0, even at Halloween.
460,00:15:50.000,00:15:51.000,1.0, You got the witch
461,00:15:51.000,00:15:52.000,1.0, with the magic brew
462,00:15:52.000,00:15:53.000,1.0, with the frogs popping out.
463,00:15:53.000,00:15:54.000,1.0, All these symbols
464,00:15:54.000,00:15:55.000,1.0, come from the ancient pagan world.
465,00:15:55.000,00:15:56.000,1.0, He's stepping through
466,00:15:56.000,00:15:57.000,1.0, the Ebzu
467,00:15:57.000,00:15:58.000,1.0, with the little fishes in there.
468,00:15:58.000,00:15:59.000,1.0, He's got the
469,00:15:59.000,00:16:00.000,1.0, that's the illusory
470,00:16:00.000,00:16:01.000,1.0, tree of life on his head
471,00:16:01.000,00:16:02.000,1.0, is what that symbol
472,00:16:02.000,00:16:03.000,1.0, is meant to represent.
473,00:16:03.000,00:16:04.000,1.0, It's also where you get
474,00:16:04.000,00:16:05.000,1.0, the witch's hat
475,00:16:05.000,00:16:06.000,1.0, of this modern age.
476,00:16:06.000,00:16:07.000,1.0, The crow the raven
477,00:16:07.000,00:16:08.000,1.0, is not only highly regarded
478,00:16:08.000,00:16:09.000,1.0, by the occult today
479,00:16:09.000,00:16:10.000,1.0, but is the bird
480,00:16:10.000,00:16:11.000,1.0, deified
481,00:16:11.000,00:16:12.000,1.0, made a god
482,00:16:12.000,00:16:13.000,1.0, by both the epic
483,00:16:13.000,00:16:14.000,1.0, of Gilgamesh
484,00:16:14.000,00:16:15.000,1.0, flood account
485,00:16:15.000,00:16:16.000,1.0, and the Eridu genesis.
486,00:16:16.000,00:16:17.000,1.0, Eridu is where
487,00:16:17.000,00:16:18.000,1.0, the Tower of Babel was.
488,00:16:18.000,00:16:19.000,1.0, You have two birds
489,00:16:19.000,00:16:20.000,1.0, that were released.
490,00:16:20.000,00:16:21.000,1.0, The epic of Gilgamesh
491,00:16:21.000,00:16:22.000,1.0, and the Sumerian texts
492,00:16:22.000,00:16:23.000,1.0, all glorify
493,00:16:23.000,00:16:24.000,1.0, the crow
494,00:16:24.000,00:16:25.000,1.0, the raven
495,00:16:25.000,00:16:26.000,1.0, the falcon.
496,00:16:26.000,00:16:27.000,1.0, The Bible
497,00:16:27.000,00:16:28.000,1.0, glorifies the dove.
498,00:16:28.000,00:16:29.000,1.0, Again
499,00:16:29.000,00:16:30.000,1.0, you're back
500,00:16:30.000,00:16:31.000,1.0, you're always back
501,00:16:31.000,00:16:32.000,1.0, to the two trees.
502,00:16:32.000,00:16:33.000,1.0, Choose to stay
503,00:16:33.000,00:16:34.000,1.0, who you serve.
504,00:16:34.000,00:16:35.000,1.0, Now if we look
505,00:16:35.000,00:16:36.000,1.0, at Job 1
506,00:16:36.000,00:16:37.000,1.0, okay so Noah
507,00:16:37.000,00:16:38.000,1.0, opened the door
508,00:16:38.000,00:16:39.000,1.0, and he sent out a raven
509,00:16:39.000,00:16:40.000,1.0, and it kept flying
510,00:16:40.000,00:16:41.000,1.0, to and fro.
511,00:16:41.000,00:16:42.000,1.0, That's a direct quote
512,00:16:42.000,00:16:43.000,1.0, from Genesis 8.
513,00:16:43.000,00:16:44.000,1.0, Now if we read
514,00:16:44.000,00:16:45.000,1.0, to Job 1 6
515,00:16:45.000,00:16:46.000,1.0, it says
516,00:16:46.000,00:16:47.000,1.0, always notice the numbers
517,00:16:47.000,00:16:48.000,1.0, verse 6
518,00:16:48.000,00:16:49.000,1.0, the Beneha Elohim
519,00:16:49.000,00:16:50.000,1.0, that means the angels
520,00:16:50.000,00:16:51.000,1.0, came to present themselves
521,00:16:51.000,00:16:52.000,1.0, before the Lord
522,00:16:52.000,00:16:53.000,1.0, and Satan
523,00:16:53.000,00:16:54.000,1.0, was amongst them.
524,00:16:54.000,00:16:55.000,1.0, And the Lord
525,00:16:55.000,00:16:56.000,1.0, said to Satan
526,00:16:56.000,00:16:57.000,1.0, the accuser of the brethren
527,00:16:57.000,00:16:58.000,1.0, where havest thou come?
528,00:16:58.000,00:16:59.000,1.0, And Satan
529,00:16:59.000,00:17:00.000,1.0, answered the Lord
530,00:17:00.000,00:17:01.000,1.0, from roaming
531,00:17:01.000,00:17:02.000,1.0, the earth
532,00:17:02.000,00:17:03.000,1.0, and from going
533,00:17:03.000,00:17:04.000,1.0, to and fro
534,00:17:04.000,00:17:05.000,1.0, in it.
535,00:17:05.000,00:17:06.000,1.0, Just like the dark crow.
536,00:17:06.000,00:17:07.000,1.0, We're going to close there
537,00:17:07.000,00:17:08.000,1.0, the representative
538,00:17:08.000,00:17:09.000,1.0, of the crow.
539,00:17:09.000,00:17:10.000,1.0, These are
540,00:17:10.000,00:17:11.000,1.0, and we're going to
541,00:17:11.000,00:17:12.000,1.0, go over some more
542,00:17:12.000,00:17:13.000,1.0, of this stuff
543,00:17:13.000,00:17:14.000,1.0, including the signs
544,00:17:14.000,00:17:15.000,1.0, and the heavens
545,00:17:15.000,00:17:16.000,1.0, and all of this
546,00:17:16.000,00:17:17.000,1.0, what the occult
547,00:17:17.000,00:17:18.000,1.0, I believe it's important
548,00:17:18.000,00:17:19.000,1.0, for you to understand
549,00:17:19.000,00:17:21.000,2.0, what the occult believes.
550,00:17:21.000,00:17:22.000,1.0, The history
551,00:17:22.000,00:17:23.000,1.0, has always been the same
552,00:17:23.000,00:17:25.000,2.0, between the Torah
553,00:17:25.000,00:17:26.000,1.0, or the Bible
554,00:17:26.000,00:17:28.000,2.0, and the occult.
555,00:17:28.000,00:17:29.000,1.0, They're the same.
556,00:17:29.000,00:17:30.000,1.0, And when you say demonic
557,00:17:30.000,00:17:31.000,1.0, you're really saying
558,00:17:31.000,00:17:32.000,1.0, man based.
559,00:17:32.000,00:17:33.000,1.0, So when you're saying
560,00:17:33.000,00:17:34.000,1.0, the doctrines of devils
561,00:17:34.000,00:17:35.000,1.0, you're really saying
562,00:17:35.000,00:17:37.000,2.0, the doctors of men.
563,00:17:37.000,00:17:38.000,1.0, You have the Lord
564,00:17:38.000,00:17:39.000,1.0, and you have the doctrines
565,00:17:39.000,00:17:40.000,1.0, of men
566,00:17:40.000,00:17:41.000,1.0, the doctrines of devils.
567,00:17:41.000,00:17:42.000,1.0, When Jesus stood out there
568,00:17:42.000,00:17:43.000,1.0, on the ship
569,00:17:43.000,00:17:44.000,1.0, and he was actually
570,00:17:44.000,00:17:45.000,1.0, the disciples
571,00:17:45.000,00:17:46.000,1.0, were terrified.
572,00:17:46.000,00:17:47.000,1.0, Just like many
573,00:17:47.000,00:17:48.000,1.0, are terrified right now
574,00:17:48.000,00:17:49.000,1.0, in these hours.
575,00:17:49.000,00:17:50.000,1.0, And the ship was rocking
576,00:17:50.000,00:17:51.000,1.0, and they thought
577,00:17:51.000,00:17:52.000,1.0, oh it's going to go down
578,00:17:52.000,00:17:53.000,1.0, every sign says
579,00:17:53.000,00:17:54.000,1.0, it's going to go down
580,00:17:54.000,00:17:55.000,1.0, and where does it say Jesus was?
581,00:17:55.000,00:17:56.000,1.0, He was asleep
582,00:17:56.000,00:17:57.000,1.0, in the bottom of the boat.
583,00:17:57.000,00:17:58.000,1.0, They only came and got him
584,00:17:58.000,00:17:59.000,1.0, when they needed him.
585,00:17:59.000,00:18:00.000,1.0, When it looked desperate.
586,00:18:00.000,00:18:01.000,1.0, What did he say?
587,00:18:01.000,00:18:02.000,1.0, He said we're dying man.
588,00:18:02.000,00:18:03.000,1.0, They've got Jesus on the boat.
589,00:18:03.000,00:18:04.000,1.0, They've seen all these miracles
590,00:18:04.000,00:18:06.000,2.0, just like the Hebrews did
591,00:18:06.000,00:18:07.000,1.0, in the Exodus.
592,00:18:07.000,00:18:08.000,1.0, The waters are parted
593,00:18:08.000,00:18:09.000,1.0, and they're out there
594,00:18:09.000,00:18:10.000,1.0, making a cow.
595,00:18:10.000,00:18:11.000,1.0, We're dying.
596,00:18:11.000,00:18:12.000,1.0, We're going to die.
597,00:18:12.000,00:18:13.000,1.0, We're all going to die.
598,00:18:13.000,00:18:14.000,1.0, That's the guy
599,00:18:14.000,00:18:15.000,1.0, that's been raising people
600,00:18:15.000,00:18:16.000,1.0, from the dead.
601,00:18:16.000,00:18:18.000,2.0, Oh ye of little faith.
602,00:18:18.000,00:18:19.000,1.0, Then he walks out there
603,00:18:19.000,00:18:20.000,1.0, in the bow of the boat.
604,00:18:20.000,00:18:21.000,1.0, It says the winds
605,00:18:21.000,00:18:22.000,1.0, and the waves.
606,00:18:22.000,00:18:23.000,1.0, The winds always represent
607,00:18:23.000,00:18:24.000,1.0, the doctrines.
608,00:18:24.000,00:18:25.000,1.0, All words have a literal
609,00:18:25.000,00:18:26.000,1.0, and a symbolic meaning.
610,00:18:26.000,00:18:27.000,1.0, All words.
611,00:18:27.000,00:18:28.000,1.0, Particularly in the Bible.
612,00:18:28.000,00:18:29.000,1.0, The winds represent
613,00:18:29.000,00:18:30.000,1.0, the doctrines of men.
614,00:18:30.000,00:18:31.000,1.0, The doctrines of devils.
615,00:18:31.000,00:18:33.000,2.0, The winds were violent.
616,00:18:33.000,00:18:34.000,1.0, And the waves.
617,00:18:34.000,00:18:36.000,2.0, Waves represent the oceans.
618,00:18:36.000,00:18:37.000,1.0, And Jesus walked
619,00:18:37.000,00:18:38.000,1.0, to the bow of the boat.
620,00:18:38.000,00:18:39.000,1.0, The front head of the boat.
621,00:18:39.000,00:18:40.000,1.0, And he said
622,00:18:40.000,00:18:41.000,1.0, peace be still.
623,00:18:41.000,00:18:43.000,2.0, And both obeyed him.
624,00:18:43.000,00:18:44.000,1.0, I speak right now
625,00:18:44.000,00:18:45.000,1.0, in this video.
626,00:18:45.000,00:18:46.000,1.0, You're not there.
627,00:18:46.000,00:18:47.000,1.0, You're not to the end time
628,00:18:47.000,00:18:48.000,1.0, part of this story yet.
629,00:18:48.000,00:18:49.000,1.0, The end time revolves
630,00:18:49.000,00:18:50.000,1.0, around Israel.
631,00:18:50.000,00:18:51.000,1.0, You're not there yet.
632,00:18:51.000,00:18:52.000,1.0, You're what has always
633,00:18:52.000,00:18:53.000,1.0, been in the world.
634,00:18:53.000,00:18:54.000,1.0, The Lord's about to bring
635,00:18:54.000,00:18:55.000,1.0, some things that he's
636,00:18:55.000,00:18:56.000,1.0, been talking about
637,00:18:56.000,00:18:57.000,1.0, since the beginning
638,00:18:57.000,00:18:58.000,1.0, of the book.
639,00:18:58.000,00:19:00.000,2.0, Together like a perfect glove.
640,00:19:00.000,00:19:01.000,1.0, And the Lord God said
641,00:19:01.000,00:19:02.000,1.0, the man has now
642,00:19:02.000,00:19:04.000,2.0, become one of us.
643,00:19:04.000,00:19:05.000,1.0, That's because
644,00:19:05.000,00:19:06.000,1.0, what you're looking at
645,00:19:06.000,00:19:07.000,1.0, in the opening of Genesis
646,00:19:07.000,00:19:08.000,1.0, is that God's being
647,00:19:08.000,00:19:10.000,2.0, represented in a triplicate.
648,00:19:10.000,00:19:11.000,1.0, Triplicate.
649,00:19:11.000,00:19:12.000,1.0, I'll explain that more
650,00:19:12.000,00:19:13.000,1.0, in detail as well.
651,00:19:13.000,00:19:15.000,2.0, He must not be allowed
652,00:19:15.000,00:19:16.000,1.0, to reach out his hand
653,00:19:16.000,00:19:18.000,2.0, and take from the tree of life
654,00:19:18.000,00:19:20.000,2.0, eat and live forever.
655,00:19:20.000,00:19:21.000,1.0, Be bound to sin.
656,00:19:21.000,00:19:22.000,1.0, The nekosh.
657,00:19:22.000,00:19:23.000,1.0, The arom.
658,00:19:23.000,00:19:24.000,1.0, Forever.
659,00:19:24.000,00:19:25.000,1.0, So the Lord God
660,00:19:25.000,00:19:26.000,1.0, banished him from the garden
661,00:19:26.000,00:19:27.000,1.0, of Eden
662,00:19:27.000,00:19:28.000,1.0, to work the ground
663,00:19:28.000,00:19:30.000,2.0, from which he had been taken.
664,00:19:30.000,00:19:31.000,1.0, And after he drove
665,00:19:31.000,00:19:32.000,1.0, the man out
666,00:19:32.000,00:19:33.000,1.0, he placed
667,00:19:33.000,00:19:35.000,2.0, on the east side
668,00:19:35.000,00:19:36.000,1.0, of the garden
669,00:19:36.000,00:19:37.000,1.0, of Eden
670,00:19:37.000,00:19:38.000,1.0, cherubim
671,00:19:38.000,00:19:41.000,3.0, and a flaming sword.
672,00:19:41.000,00:19:42.000,1.0, The sword.
673,00:19:42.000,00:19:43.000,1.0, The sword is the Bible.
674,00:19:43.000,00:19:45.000,2.0, The sword is the truth.
675,00:19:45.000,00:19:47.000,2.0, The flesh this way and that.
676,00:19:47.000,00:19:49.000,2.0, This way and back and forth.
677,00:19:49.000,00:19:51.000,2.0, To guard the way
678,00:19:51.000,00:19:53.000,2.0, to the tree of life.
679,00:19:53.000,00:19:54.000,1.0, Jesus said
680,00:19:54.000,00:19:56.000,2.0," so the sword is the truth, right?"
681,00:19:56.000,00:19:57.000,1.0, To guard the way
682,00:19:57.000,00:19:59.000,2.0, to the tree of life.
683,00:19:59.000,00:20:01.000,2.0, The way to the tree of life.
684,00:20:01.000,00:20:03.000,2.0, What did Jesus always say?
685,00:20:03.000,00:20:05.000,2.0, I am the way
686,00:20:05.000,00:20:06.000,1.0, the truth
687,00:20:06.000,00:20:07.000,1.0, and the life.
688,00:20:07.000,00:20:09.000,2.0, No man cometh before the Father
689,00:20:09.000,00:20:11.000,2.0, goes to that tree of life
690,00:20:11.000,00:20:13.000,2.0, but by me
691,00:20:13.000,00:20:15.000,2.0, Jesus Christ.
692,00:20:15.000,00:20:16.000,1.0, We're going to stop there
693,00:20:16.000,00:20:18.000,2.0, on that version
694,00:20:18.000,00:20:20.000,2.0, of walking through these.
695,00:20:20.000,00:20:21.000,1.0, I'm going to have
696,00:20:21.000,00:20:22.000,1.0, I'm going to take you through
697,00:20:22.000,00:20:24.000,2.0, the Tiamat
698,00:20:24.000,00:20:25.000,1.0, and the snake
699,00:20:25.000,00:20:26.000,1.0, as it makes its way
700,00:20:26.000,00:20:27.000,1.0, through history
701,00:20:27.000,00:20:28.000,1.0, as we continue
702,00:20:28.000,00:20:29.000,1.0, in the partner section
703,00:20:29.000,00:20:31.000,2.0, at GodInANutshell.com
704,00:20:31.000,00:20:32.000,1.0, God bless
705,00:20:32.000,00:20:34.000,2.0, every last one of you
706,00:20:34.000,00:20:36.000,2.0, and your families
707,00:20:36.000,00:20:37.000,1.0, on the other side
708,00:20:37.000,00:20:39.000,2.0, of the screen.
