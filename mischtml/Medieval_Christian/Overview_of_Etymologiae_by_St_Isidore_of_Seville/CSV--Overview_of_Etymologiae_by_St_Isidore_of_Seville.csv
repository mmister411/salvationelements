0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.840,5.840000152587891, Saint Isidore of Seville was one of the greatest doctors of late antiquity. He
1,00:00:05.840,00:00:10.800,4.960000038146973," served as the Archbishop of Seville, attended several councils, and helped"
2,00:00:10.800,00:00:15.439,4.6399993896484375, convert the Visigothic King of Spain to Catholic Christianity. Throughout his
3,00:00:15.439,00:00:20.639,5.199999809265137," life, he was an avid scholar of the classical world and a prolific writer. By"
4,00:00:20.639,00:00:25.959,5.319999694824219," the time of his death in AD 636, he had written numerous books covering a wide"
5,00:00:25.959,00:00:31.600,5.64000129699707," range of topics such as history, astronomy, and theology. His writings"
6,00:00:31.600,00:00:36.680,5.079999923706055, would later go on to have a profound impact on medieval thinking. Saint
7,00:00:36.680,00:00:41.560,4.880001068115234," Isidore's most influential work is Etymologi, which is an etymological"
8,00:00:41.560,00:00:47.599,6.039997100830078, encyclopedia and one of the first summas of universal knowledge. Etymologi
9,00:00:47.599,00:00:52.119,4.520000457763672, is comprised of 20 books that contain knowledge primarily drawn from the
10,00:00:52.119,00:00:57.400,5.280002593994141," classics. Its sources include authors such as St. Augustine, St. Jerome,"
11,00:00:57.400,00:01:04.800,7.400001525878906," Aristotle, Plato, and Cato. Etymologi's first three books deal with the seven"
12,00:01:04.800,00:01:10.040,5.239997863769531, liberal arts which are composed of the trivium and the quadrivium. The trivium
13,00:01:10.040,00:01:16.400,6.3600006103515625," is made up of three disciplines, grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The quadrivium is"
14,00:01:16.400,00:01:23.240,6.840003967285156," made up of four disciplines, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The seven"
15,00:01:23.240,00:01:28.040,4.8000030517578125, disciplines that make up the trivium and the quadrivium were called the liberal
16,00:01:28.040,00:01:32.680,4.6399993896484375, arts because they were considered essential for a free person to know in
17,00:01:32.680,00:01:39.080,6.399993896484375, order to actively participate in civic life. The fourth book is about medicine.
18,00:01:39.080,00:01:45.520,6.44000244140625," It includes information about the four humors, black bile, bile, blood, and phlegm."

20,00:01:50.840,00:01:57.680,6.840003967285156," discusses the three schools of medicine, empirical, logical, and methodical."
21,00:01:57.680,00:02:04.320,6.6399993896484375," Book five is about law and chronology. On the subject of law, St. Isidore discusses"
22,00:02:04.320,00:02:09.600,5.279998779296875," the differences between natural, civil, international, military, and public law."
23,00:02:09.600,00:02:15.199,5.5999908447265625," Regarding chronology, St. Isidore covers periods of time such as days, weeks,"
24,00:02:15.199,00:02:23.360,8.160003662109375," months, as well as solstices, equinoxes, seasons, and special years. The next"
25,00:02:23.360,00:02:28.760,5.4000091552734375," several books discuss theological topics such as God, angels, and saints, as well as"
26,00:02:28.760,00:02:33.440,4.67999267578125," the Roman Catholic Church and non-christian sects. On the topic of God,"
27,00:02:33.440,00:02:38.720,5.279998779296875," St. Isidore explains the Trinity, as well as the qualities and names of God"
28,00:02:38.720,00:02:43.760,5.040008544921875," Regarding non-christian sects, St. Isidore mentions figures such as Zoroaster,"
29,00:02:43.760,00:02:50.280,6.5200042724609375," Plato, and Donatus. However, St. Isidore's most noteworthy contemporary, Muhammad,"
30,00:02:50.280,00:02:55.560,5.279998779296875, is not mentioned at all. Perhaps this is because Muhammad and his followers did
31,00:02:55.560,00:03:01.480,5.9199981689453125, not become well-known until several decades after Etymologi was written.
32,00:03:01.480,00:03:08.400,6.9199981689453125," The ninth book discusses languages, peoples, kingdoms, armies, cities, and titles."

35,00:03:18.720,00:03:24.800,6.0800018310546875," Africa. Japheth's descendants largely fled to Europe. However, Shem's descendants"
36,00:03:24.800,00:03:31.400,6.600006103515625, mostly stayed in the Middle East. Book 10 is about vocabulary. It provides a
37,00:03:31.400,00:03:36.840,5.44000244140625, word list of adjectives and nouns with their etymological origin. The word list
38,00:03:36.840,00:03:43.200,6.3600006103515625, is arranged in alphabetical order and looks similar to a modern dictionary.
39,00:03:43.200,00:03:48.360,5.1599884033203125," The eleventh book delves into topics such as mankind, portents, and transformations."

44,00:04:13.960,00:04:19.200,5.239990234375," and geography. On the subject of geography, St. Isidore describes the"
45,00:04:19.200,00:04:26.200,7.0," world as being circular and composed of three continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa,"
46,00:04:26.200,00:04:32.679,6.47998046875, with a great ocean that surrounds them. The fifteenth book is about buildings and

50,00:04:48.279,00:04:55.119,6.839996337890625, kinds of fields and rural infrastructure. The next book covers rocks and metals.

52,00:05:01.839,00:05:07.399,5.55999755859375," moves on to talk about the various kinds of stones, gems, and glass. In the second"
53,00:05:07.399,00:05:11.839,4.44000244140625," half of the book, St. Isidore discusses the various kinds of metals such as gold,"

56,00:05:25.559,00:05:33.119,7.55999755859375," war, and jurisprudence. Throughout the medieval period, etymologi was the most"
57,00:05:33.119,00:05:39.119,6.0," widely used textbook. In fact, etymologi was so widely used that it often"
58,00:05:39.119,00:05:43.239,4.1199951171875," replaced individual works of the classics themselves, many of which were"
59,00:05:43.239,00:05:49.040,5.800018310546875, no longer copied and therefore lost as a consequence. No work other than the Holy
60,00:05:49.040,00:05:55.880,6.839996337890625, Bible was as influential on medieval thinking as etymologi.
