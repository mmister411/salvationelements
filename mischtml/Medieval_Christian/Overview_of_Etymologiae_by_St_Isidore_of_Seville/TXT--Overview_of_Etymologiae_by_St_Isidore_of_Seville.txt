He served as the Archbishop of Seville, attended several councils, and helped convert the Visigothic King of Spain to Catholic Christianity. Throughout his life, he was an avid scholar of the classical world and a prolific writer. By the time of his death in AD 636, he had written numerous books covering a wide range of topics such as history, astronomy, and theology. His writings would later go on to have a profound impact on medieval thinking.

Saint Isidore's most influential work is Etymologi, which is an etymological encyclopedia and one of the first summas of universal knowledge. Etymologi is comprised of 20 books that contain knowledge primarily drawn from the classics. Its sources include authors such as St. Augustine, St. Jerome, Aristotle, Plato, and Cato.

Etymologi's first three books deal with the seven liberal arts which are composed of the trivium and the quadrivium. The trivium is made up of three disciplines: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The quadrivium is made up of four disciplines: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The seven disciplines that make up the trivium and the quadrivium were called the liberal arts because they were considered essential for a free person to know in order to actively participate in civic life.

The next several books discuss theological topics such as God, angels, and saints, as well as the Roman Catholic Church and non-Christian sects. On the topic of God, St. Isidore explains the Trinity, as well as the qualities and names of God. Regarding non-Christian sects, St. Isidore mentions figures such as Zoroaster, Plato, and Donatus. However, St. Isidore's most noteworthy contemporary, Muhammad, is not mentioned at all. Perhaps this is because Muhammad and his followers did not become well-known until several decades after Etymologi was written.

Throughout the medieval period, Etymologi was the most widely used textbook. In fact, Etymologi was so widely used that it often replaced individual works of the classics themselves, many of which were no longer copied and therefore lost as a consequence. No work other than the Holy Bible was as influential on medieval thinking as Etymologi.
