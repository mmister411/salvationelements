            <p>Saint Isidore's most influential work is Etymologi, which is an etymological encyclopedia and one of the first summas of universal knowledge. Etymologi is comprised of 20 books that contain knowledge primarily drawn from the classics. Its sources include authors such as St. Augustine, St. Jerome, Aristotle, Plato, and Cato.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Etymologi's first three books deal with the seven liberal arts which are composed of the trivium and the quadrivium. The trivium is made up of three disciplines: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The quadrivium is made up of four disciplines: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The seven disciplines that make up the trivium and the quadrivium were called the liberal arts because they were considered essential for a free person to know in order to actively participate in civic life.

            <p>The fourth book is about medicine. It includes information about the four humors: black bile, bile, blood, and phlegm. The book briefly outlines diseases, remedies, and medical instruments. It also discusses the three schools of medicine: empirical, logical, and methodical.

            <p>Book five is about law and chronology. On the subject of law, St. Isidore discusses the differences between natural, civil, international, military, and public law. Regarding chronology, St. Isidore covers periods of time such as days, weeks, months, as well as solstices, equinoxes, seasons, and special years.

            <p>The next several books discuss theological topics such as God, angels, and saints, as well as the Roman Catholic Church and non-Christian sects. On the topic of God, St. Isidore explains the Trinity, as well as the qualities and names of God. Regarding non-Christian sects, St. Isidore mentions figures such as Zoroaster, Plato, and Donatus. However, St. Isidore's most noteworthy contemporary, Muhammad, is not mentioned at all. Perhaps this is because Muhammad and his followers did not become well-known until several decades after Etymologi was written.

It explains that Ham's descendants migrated to the continent of Africa. Japheth's descendants largely fled to Europe. However, Shem's descendants mostly stayed in the Middle East.
