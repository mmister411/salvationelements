And so you had these ancient groups, groups that we refer to as the Gnostics, the Doketics, and what they did is they appropriated Jesus and put their theology on the lips of Jesus in later centuries, and then they attached the names for credibility's sake to those documents. But we know, based on both the content and based on how we date these manuscripts, that they're coming from times when Thomas, when Peter, when Mary, when Judas were long dead.

Many ancient texts like the Nag Hammadi library ended up in small villages in rural Egypt, found by farmers and in some cases archaeologists. Documents like the Gospel of Thomas, Philip, and Judas found their origins with a number of mystic religious sects from across the ancient world. After their discovery by the Bedouin farmers in 1945, they almost didn't survive. Some of the ancient papyri were tossed into a courtyard full of animals, others used as kindling to cook bread.

Many of these ancient papyri found in the desert, biblical or otherwise, often defy the odds when it comes to surviving for centuries.
