00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
 We have discovered manuscripts that go back to the 2nd century.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.479
 And what's on the screen for you is a copy of a late 2nd century, early 3rd century copy of the Gospel of John.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.279
 It's called P66.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.719
 And that's because scholars are very imaginative, and it's made out of papyrus, so they said,

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.680
 well, let's call it P.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.000
 And how many do we have before this? We have 65. P66.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.959
 It takes doctoral-level work to figure that kind of stuff out.

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:34.559
 But what's really interesting about P66 is that if we're dealing with a book with a codex,

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.600
 the front and back are very vulnerable to time, to wear and tear, to worms, to all sorts of things.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 And so we don't actually have, we have a lot of middles of books,

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.440
 but we don't have a lot of, if it's a single book, the beginning and end are always the most vulnerable.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.920
 P66 preserves for us the beginning of the Gospel of John.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.959
 And if you read with me along on the screen, it says,

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:02.399
 or I'll make it easier for you.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.119
 We can go, you, sir.

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.599
 You know, it's really interesting.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:10.279
 If you look at P66 and you translate through it, what it says is,

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:13.319
 in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.719
 He was in the beginning with God.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.839
 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.
