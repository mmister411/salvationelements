0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.840,4.840000152587891, We have discovered manuscripts that go back to the 2nd century.
1,00:00:04.840,00:00:12.479,7.6399993896484375," And what's on the screen for you is a copy of a late 2nd century, early 3rd century copy of the Gospel of John."
2,00:00:12.479,00:00:14.279,1.8000001907348633, It's called P66.
3,00:00:14.279,00:00:18.719,4.439999580383301," And that's because scholars are very imaginative, and it's made out of papyrus, so they said,"
4,00:00:18.719,00:00:20.680,1.960000991821289," well, let's call it P."
5,00:00:20.680,00:00:25.000,4.319999694824219, And how many do we have before this? We have 65. P66.
6,00:00:25.000,00:00:28.959,3.9599990844726562, It takes doctoral-level work to figure that kind of stuff out.
7,00:00:28.959,00:00:34.559,5.600000381469727," But what's really interesting about P66 is that if we're dealing with a book with a codex,"
8,00:00:34.559,00:00:43.600,9.040000915527344," the front and back are very vulnerable to time, to wear and tear, to worms, to all sorts of things."
9,00:00:43.600,00:00:47.039,3.4399986267089844," And so we don't actually have, we have a lot of middles of books,"
10,00:00:47.039,00:00:52.440,5.400001525878906," but we don't have a lot of, if it's a single book, the beginning and end are always the most vulnerable."
11,00:00:52.440,00:00:56.920,4.479999542236328, P66 preserves for us the beginning of the Gospel of John.
12,00:00:56.920,00:01:00.959,4.039997100830078," And if you read with me along on the screen, it says,"
13,00:01:00.959,00:01:02.399,1.44000244140625, or I'll make it easier for you.
14,00:01:02.399,00:01:04.119,1.7199974060058594," We can go, you, sir."
15,00:01:04.119,00:01:05.599,1.4799957275390625," You know, it's really interesting."
16,00:01:05.599,00:01:10.279,4.680000305175781," If you look at P66 and you translate through it, what it says is,"
17,00:01:10.279,00:01:13.319,3.0400009155273438," in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
18,00:01:13.319,00:01:14.719,1.4000015258789062, He was in the beginning with God.
19,00:01:14.719,00:01:18.839,4.120002746582031," All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made."
