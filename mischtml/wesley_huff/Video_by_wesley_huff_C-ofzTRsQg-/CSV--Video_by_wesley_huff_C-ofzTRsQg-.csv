4,00:00:19.680,00:00:24.399,4.719999313354492," The core of what Matt's objection appears to be, though, God's revelation is not clear enough."

12,00:00:55.680,00:01:00.959,5.279998779296875," emotions. People don't make decisions simply based on the evidence, and Dillahunty makes it"

18,00:01:25.040,00:01:30.559,5.519996643066406, much of a level that merits no debate. This isn't how history works. This isn't how science works.
19,00:01:30.559,00:01:35.040,4.480003356933594," Physicists debate on the existence of gravity and consciousness, energy, whether sound is a wave or"

25,00:01:59.360,00:02:04.479,5.1199951171875, James 2.19 says that demons believe and shudder. God doesn't merely want our belief. He wants our
