00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Hello, my name is Juan Marcos Wimberling-Terrace. I'm on the road driving, but I'm extremely

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.600
 excited because I'm going to be releasing my latest book, titled Enoch Rising, in Minduranki,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.799
 The Fallen Watchers, and The Key to Unlocking Early Christianity. I'll be releasing that

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:22.399
 in the next day or so, and this is a fascinating topic. I mean, there's a lot of material that's

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:28.799
 been written on it, a lot of people published on Amazon, the basic text of the book of Enoch,

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:35.520
 2 Enoch, and then what's referred to as Sefer Hechalot, the Book of Palaces, or 3 Enoch in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.119
 academic circles. But a lot of material has not been written, or I should say there's a lack of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:47.600
 material that's been written on the historical aspects and development of Enoch and the titles

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.720
 that were assigned to him. So what I wanted to do is I wanted to look at the person of Enoch,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.520
 as reflected in the biblical text, and then look at the literature that developed around him,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.959
 and how his function, or his functions and the titles that were assigned to him, continue to

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:12.079
 evolve. And the reason that that's important, at least for my study, is because it informs us about

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.319
 the concepts that the writers of the New Testament drew from. But it's also fascinating because

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:25.439
 there's a stream of Jewish thought that continue to preserve these types of ideas in mystical

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.319
 circles. So Sefer Hechalot, for example, is what's referred to as 3 Enoch. But it's clearly a

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:39.839
 rabbinic text, and it's likely that it was written sometime in the 5th century CE of the Common Era,

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:47.119
 so it's a rather late text. But it continues to follow the development of this idea of an

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.679
 exalted patriarch, and in that case, in Sefer Hechalot, his transformation into

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:00.799
 Metatron, this exalted principal angel. But you see the seeds of that even in 1st Enoch,

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.959
 and of course into 2nd Enoch, and you can see, at least from my perspective, the impact

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.799
 that that had on the development of the New Testament. Or at the very least,

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:15.039
 you can understand the milieu that the writers of the New Testament had to draw from.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:20.799
 So there are concepts that they attributed to Jesus, messianic roles and different titles,

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.439
 because Jesus in the New Testament is referred to as a prophet, he reveals mysteries, he's a healer,

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:33.759
 there are many different things that he is assigned and described. But a lot of these functions you

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:39.519
 can find parallels not simply in Qumran or other writings, but specifically in the Enochic

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:48.479
 literature. And the literature of Enoch is fascinating because in many ways it presents

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:56.319
 an alternative Jewish worldview. We're accustomed, of course, to movements like the Parishim,

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.999
 the Pharisees, and the Covenanters in Qumran and so forth that were very dedicated to

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:08.079
 the centrality of Torah, of the Law of Moses, as most people refer to it,

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:15.759
 as the central tenet of their faith. And of course it makes sense in terms of later Judaism,

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:21.439
 because Evolver and Bidding Judaism maintains this commitment to the Torah as a center

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:30.159
 of a Jewish relationship with Hashem, with God. But there were apparently other Jewish groups,

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.720
 other Jewish movements, even, if you want to say, other Jewish Judaisms, that had a different

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.159
 worldview where there wasn't necessarily a conflict with the Torah, but the Torah was

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:52.720
 seen not as necessarily the pinnacle of, or the focus, I should say, of revelation. And so this

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.920
 is why Enoch in many ways is fascinating, because there's a lot of seeming parallels between

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.280
 his movement that grew up around him and what we see in certain aspects of the New Testament.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.920
 And one of the things I've mentioned in the past, I'm sorry about that,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.719
 is that my thoughts on the development of the New Testament in early Christianity

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:19.040
 are such that I really believe that there were multiple streams of thought in early Christianity,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.559
 and that when you read the books of the New Testament from an academic perspective,

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:31.119
 you should realize that there's not necessarily a continuity between one book and another. That

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:35.999
 is to say that each book has to be read independently on its own terms and on its own

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:42.879
 merits. And the ideas that are expressed in one book may have reflected the perspectives of a

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:49.279
 particular group of early Jews who followed Jesus or supported his Messianic claims,

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.159
 while another book or another epistle may have supported the perspectives of another group.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.480
 The Apostle Paul makes reference to that in his letter, I believe, to the Corinthians,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.719
 where he talks about different groups. And there's nothing inconsistent with that that's reflected

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.200
 in the New Testament itself. In the book of Acts, there's mention that there were Pharisees that

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.680
 were followers of Jesus. There were priests who had joined the movement. So to me, it's a

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.400
 multifaceted movement. And consequently, there are different streams of thought and even theology

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.240
 that are reflected in that. And I think Enoch provides an excellent basis of comparison,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.279
 and gives us an ability to eliminate a lot of these topics. So in any case, I'll continue to

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:36.319
 make these videos and update you on the status of the book, and also start to talk a little bit

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:43.839
 about the details of what I'm covering in the book and what I'd like to cover in future lectures.
