0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.400,4.400000095367432," Hello, my name is Juan Marcos Wimberling-Terrace. I'm on the road driving, but I'm extremely"
1,00:00:04.400,00:00:11.600,7.200000286102295," excited because I'm going to be releasing my latest book, titled Enoch Rising, in Minduranki,"
2,00:00:11.600,00:00:16.799,5.19999885559082," The Fallen Watchers, and The Key to Unlocking Early Christianity. I'll be releasing that"
3,00:00:16.799,00:00:22.399,5.600000381469727," in the next day or so, and this is a fascinating topic. I mean, there's a lot of material that's"
4,00:00:22.399,00:00:28.799,6.399999618530273," been written on it, a lot of people published on Amazon, the basic text of the book of Enoch,"
5,00:00:28.799,00:00:35.520,6.720001220703125," 2 Enoch, and then what's referred to as Sefer Hechalot, the Book of Palaces, or 3 Enoch in"
6,00:00:35.520,00:00:41.119,5.599998474121094," academic circles. But a lot of material has not been written, or I should say there's a lack of"
7,00:00:41.119,00:00:47.600,6.480003356933594, material that's been written on the historical aspects and development of Enoch and the titles
8,00:00:47.600,00:00:52.720,5.119998931884766," that were assigned to him. So what I wanted to do is I wanted to look at the person of Enoch,"
9,00:00:52.720,00:00:57.520,4.799999237060547," as reflected in the biblical text, and then look at the literature that developed around him,"
10,00:00:57.520,00:01:04.959,7.439998626708984," and how his function, or his functions and the titles that were assigned to him, continue to"
11,00:01:04.959,00:01:12.079,7.1199951171875," evolve. And the reason that that's important, at least for my study, is because it informs us about"
12,00:01:12.079,00:01:18.319,6.2400054931640625, the concepts that the writers of the New Testament drew from. But it's also fascinating because
13,00:01:18.319,00:01:25.439,7.1199951171875, there's a stream of Jewish thought that continue to preserve these types of ideas in mystical
14,00:01:25.439,00:01:32.319,6.8800048828125," circles. So Sefer Hechalot, for example, is what's referred to as 3 Enoch. But it's clearly a"
15,00:01:32.319,00:01:39.839,7.519996643066406," rabbinic text, and it's likely that it was written sometime in the 5th century CE of the Common Era,"
16,00:01:39.839,00:01:47.119,7.279998779296875, so it's a rather late text. But it continues to follow the development of this idea of an
17,00:01:47.119,00:01:53.679,6.55999755859375," exalted patriarch, and in that case, in Sefer Hechalot, his transformation into"
18,00:01:53.679,00:02:00.799,7.1199951171875," Metatron, this exalted principal angel. But you see the seeds of that even in 1st Enoch,"
19,00:02:00.799,00:02:04.959,4.159996032714844," and of course into 2nd Enoch, and you can see, at least from my perspective, the impact"
20,00:02:04.959,00:02:08.799,3.8400115966796875," that that had on the development of the New Testament. Or at the very least,"
21,00:02:08.799,00:02:15.039,6.239990234375, you can understand the milieu that the writers of the New Testament had to draw from.
22,00:02:15.039,00:02:20.799,5.760009765625," So there are concepts that they attributed to Jesus, messianic roles and different titles,"
23,00:02:20.799,00:02:27.439,6.6399993896484375," because Jesus in the New Testament is referred to as a prophet, he reveals mysteries, he's a healer,"
24,00:02:27.439,00:02:33.759,6.3199920654296875, there are many different things that he is assigned and described. But a lot of these functions you
25,00:02:33.759,00:02:39.519,5.760009765625," can find parallels not simply in Qumran or other writings, but specifically in the Enochic"
26,00:02:39.519,00:02:48.479,8.959991455078125, literature. And the literature of Enoch is fascinating because in many ways it presents
27,00:02:48.479,00:02:56.319,7.839996337890625," an alternative Jewish worldview. We're accustomed, of course, to movements like the Parishim,"
28,00:02:56.319,00:03:01.999,5.6800079345703125," the Pharisees, and the Covenanters in Qumran and so forth that were very dedicated to"
29,00:03:01.999,00:03:08.079,6.0800018310546875," the centrality of Torah, of the Law of Moses, as most people refer to it,"
30,00:03:08.079,00:03:15.759,7.67999267578125," as the central tenet of their faith. And of course it makes sense in terms of later Judaism,"
31,00:03:15.759,00:03:21.439,5.6800079345703125, because Evolver and Bidding Judaism maintains this commitment to the Torah as a center
32,00:03:21.439,00:03:30.159,8.720001220703125," of a Jewish relationship with Hashem, with God. But there were apparently other Jewish groups,"
33,00:03:30.159,00:03:36.720,6.5600128173828125," other Jewish movements, even, if you want to say, other Jewish Judaisms, that had a different"
34,00:03:36.720,00:03:44.159,7.4399871826171875," worldview where there wasn't necessarily a conflict with the Torah, but the Torah was"
35,00:03:44.159,00:03:52.720,8.560012817382812," seen not as necessarily the pinnacle of, or the focus, I should say, of revelation. And so this"
36,00:03:52.720,00:03:57.920,5.1999969482421875," is why Enoch in many ways is fascinating, because there's a lot of seeming parallels between"
37,00:03:57.920,00:04:05.280,7.3600006103515625, his movement that grew up around him and what we see in certain aspects of the New Testament.
38,00:04:05.280,00:04:07.920,2.6399993896484375," And one of the things I've mentioned in the past, I'm sorry about that,"
39,00:04:07.920,00:04:12.719,4.79998779296875, is that my thoughts on the development of the New Testament in early Christianity
40,00:04:12.719,00:04:19.040,6.32000732421875," are such that I really believe that there were multiple streams of thought in early Christianity,"
41,00:04:19.040,00:04:22.559,3.519989013671875," and that when you read the books of the New Testament from an academic perspective,"
42,00:04:22.559,00:04:31.119,8.55999755859375, you should realize that there's not necessarily a continuity between one book and another. That
43,00:04:31.119,00:04:35.999,4.8800048828125, is to say that each book has to be read independently on its own terms and on its own
44,00:04:35.999,00:04:42.879,6.879974365234375, merits. And the ideas that are expressed in one book may have reflected the perspectives of a
45,00:04:42.879,00:04:49.279,6.4000244140625," particular group of early Jews who followed Jesus or supported his Messianic claims,"
46,00:04:49.279,00:04:54.159,4.8800048828125, while another book or another epistle may have supported the perspectives of another group.
47,00:04:54.159,00:04:58.480,4.32000732421875," The Apostle Paul makes reference to that in his letter, I believe, to the Corinthians,"
48,00:04:58.480,00:05:02.719,4.239990234375, where he talks about different groups. And there's nothing inconsistent with that that's reflected
49,00:05:02.719,00:05:07.200,4.480010986328125," in the New Testament itself. In the book of Acts, there's mention that there were Pharisees that"
50,00:05:07.200,00:05:13.680,6.480010986328125," were followers of Jesus. There were priests who had joined the movement. So to me, it's a"
51,00:05:13.680,00:05:20.400,6.720001220703125," multifaceted movement. And consequently, there are different streams of thought and even theology"
52,00:05:20.400,00:05:26.240,5.839996337890625," that are reflected in that. And I think Enoch provides an excellent basis of comparison,"
53,00:05:26.240,00:05:31.279,5.03997802734375," and gives us an ability to eliminate a lot of these topics. So in any case, I'll continue to"
54,00:05:31.279,00:05:36.319,5.040008544921875," make these videos and update you on the status of the book, and also start to talk a little bit"
55,00:05:36.319,00:05:43.839,7.519989013671875, about the details of what I'm covering in the book and what I'd like to cover in future lectures.
