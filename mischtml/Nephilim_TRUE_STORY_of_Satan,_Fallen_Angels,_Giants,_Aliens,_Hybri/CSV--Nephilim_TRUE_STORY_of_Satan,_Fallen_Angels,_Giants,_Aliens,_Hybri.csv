0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.840,6.840000152587891, The skulls and artifacts in this video are authentic from sites all around the globe.
1,00:00:06.840,00:00:12.039,5.199999809265137," Feel free to share, but please do not download and respect the copyrights herein."
2,00:00:12.039,00:00:14.399,2.359999656677246, Viewer discretion advised.
3,00:00:14.399,00:00:23.479,9.079999923706055," So tell me straight, Rabbi, have any powerful people attempted to bury this knowledge?"
4,00:00:23.479,00:00:27.620,4.14000129699707, I tried to figure out what was the disconnect in history.
5,00:00:27.620,00:00:36.500,8.879999160766602," This video is about the Nephilim, a mystery that goes back even further than Babylon."
6,00:00:36.500,00:00:38.060,1.5600013732910156, Enjoy the ride.
7,00:00:38.060,00:00:47.299,9.239997863769531, Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterwards when the sons of God went
8,00:00:47.299,00:00:53.700,6.400001525878906, in to the daughters of men and bore children by them.
9,00:00:53.700,00:01:00.700,7.0," These were the mighty ones of old, famous warriors of ancient times."
10,00:01:00.700,00:01:07.699,6.999996185302734," If all the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd century, and then even the early Jewish commentators all"
11,00:01:07.699,00:01:11.699,4.0," stood on the same ground with this, why is there such a disconnect?"
12,00:01:11.699,00:01:13.699,2.0, I researched something interesting.
13,00:01:13.699,00:01:19.699,6.0, There was a second council in Constantinople from the early Roman church.
14,00:01:19.699,00:01:23.699,4.0, This was in 553 A.D.
15,00:01:23.699,00:01:28.699,5.0," They decreed that the teachings of Origen, an early church writer on the subject of angels,"
16,00:01:28.699,00:01:30.699,2.0, could be hearsay.
17,00:01:30.699,00:01:34.699,4.0, This guy here was found in Peru.
18,00:01:34.699,00:01:38.699,4.0, And here's a little baby one from Peru.
19,00:01:38.699,00:01:40.699,2.0, Take a look at that right there.
20,00:01:40.699,00:01:46.699,6.0, Look at the little fingers on that going up that long head.
21,00:01:46.699,00:01:50.699,4.0," This of course is Siberia, Russia."
22,00:01:50.699,00:01:54.699,4.0, Look at the size of the mallet on that one from Peru.
23,00:01:54.699,00:01:58.699,4.0," He almost doesn't look friendly, does he?"
24,00:01:58.699,00:02:02.699,4.0, And this one here is from the sands of Iran.
25,00:02:02.699,00:02:09.699,7.0, This is one of apparently about 20 from a dig site in Germany.
26,00:02:09.699,00:02:19.699,10.0," Would you say there's anything at all about that guy there that doesn't look, I don't know, human?"
27,00:02:19.699,00:02:23.699,4.0, This one was found in Bolivia.
28,00:02:23.699,00:02:24.699,1.0, Hold on to your seats.
29,00:02:24.699,00:02:31.699,7.0, We're going to go over some unique features on these long heads in just a minute.
30,00:02:31.699,00:02:35.699,4.0," Also found in Russia, Peru."
31,00:02:35.699,00:02:40.699,5.0, The sheer mass on the back of some of these is astounding.
32,00:02:40.699,00:02:42.699,2.0, Here's a child being held.
33,00:02:42.699,00:02:46.699,4.0, Look at the size of that one in the middle.
34,00:02:46.699,00:02:52.699,6.0, This may be the largest one in terms of head volume out of Peru.
35,00:02:52.699,00:02:57.699,5.0, Now we're really starting to leave the it looks human range.
36,00:02:57.699,00:03:06.699,9.0, This guy here was one of 13 found at a dig site in Mexico.
37,00:03:06.699,00:03:09.699,3.0, It's a biblical Hebrew text.
38,00:03:09.699,00:03:12.699,3.0, And you start finding a lot of strange anomalies.
39,00:03:12.699,00:03:14.699,2.0," You know, you read about giants."
40,00:03:14.699,00:03:23.699,9.0," When Moshe Moses sent the spies over into Cana, and they described this land being filled full of giants."
41,00:03:23.699,00:03:30.699,7.0," You know, when the spies come back, they said, you know, what were the size of grasshoppers compared to these men?"
42,00:03:30.699,00:03:35.699,5.0, The word Nephilim often gets translated as giants.
43,00:03:35.699,00:03:39.699,4.0, It is true there have been actual giants in history.
44,00:03:39.699,00:03:42.699,3.0, This is Robert Wadlow.
45,00:03:42.699,00:03:50.699,8.0, He's the tallest man ever officially recorded in this modern time period at 8 feet 11 inches.
46,00:03:50.699,00:03:57.700,7.0000152587890625, This photograph was taken by Roy Chapman Andrews during an expedition to Mongolia in 1922.
47,00:03:57.700,00:04:02.700,5.0, The image ran one time in National Geographic magazine.
48,00:04:02.700,00:04:05.700,3.0, It was never published in the magazine again.
49,00:04:05.700,00:04:09.700,4.0, Signals describing a guy with six fingers and toes.
50,00:04:09.700,00:04:12.700,3.0, And he's not calling it a deformity.
51,00:04:12.700,00:04:16.700,4.0," Now, you know, I've seen people who've had a toe, but it's a deformity."
52,00:04:16.700,00:04:19.700,3.0, These are six working fingers and toes.
53,00:04:19.700,00:04:27.700,8.0, I actually found an ancient picture from Babylon of a giant with six fingers and toes.
54,00:04:27.700,00:04:30.700,3.0, And the giant is actually holding a lion.
55,00:04:30.700,00:04:35.700,5.0, And he is so large that the lion is held like I would hold a cat.
56,00:04:35.700,00:04:45.700,10.0," Like I'm saying to you, only if you're reading in the Hebrew are you going to see how deep this goes and how actually clear it is."
57,00:04:45.700,00:04:52.700,7.0, It is curious where the trail can begin to lead when looking at ancient bloodlines.
58,00:04:52.700,00:05:01.700,9.0," When talking about the word Nephilim, what we're dealing with is a little bit deeper and darker and larger in scope"
59,00:05:01.700,00:05:07.700,6.0," than giantism, a really tall guy, or your favorite basketball player."
60,00:05:07.700,00:05:14.700,7.0, The term Nephilim became synonymous with giants because that's what they tended to be.
61,00:05:14.700,00:05:17.700,3.0, It is by no means limited to that meaning.
62,00:05:17.700,00:05:27.700,10.0," In fact, the word Nephilim is more of an umbrella term for the hybrid children, creatures of any high strangeness,"
63,00:05:27.700,00:05:37.700,10.0," which are actual flesh and blood, biological products of the Beneha Elohim, the fallen angels."
64,00:05:37.700,00:05:45.700,8.0," Well, first, the word Nephilim is actually a plural from the Hebrew word Nephal, fallen."
65,00:05:45.700,00:05:50.700,5.0," And when you say Nephilim, you're basically saying the fallen ones."
66,00:05:50.700,00:05:55.700,5.0," Genesis chapter 6 verses 1 through 2 says that when men began to increase,"
67,00:05:55.700,00:05:59.700,4.0," the number of the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God."
68,00:05:59.700,00:06:11.700,12.0," The term sons of God or the Beneha Elohim can mean angels, fallen angels, or in the book of Enoch, the watchers."
69,00:06:11.700,00:06:21.700,10.0, Sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they married any of them that they chose and had children by them.
70,00:06:21.700,00:06:31.700,10.0," So at this moment, without going off of any of the physical evidence and before taking a really deep look at these skulls"
71,00:06:31.700,00:06:39.700,8.0," or peering into the history and just using the texts alone, in any authentic text,"
72,00:06:39.700,00:06:45.700,6.0," whether you're dealing with actual angels or you're talking about fallen angels,"
73,00:06:45.700,00:06:52.700,7.0, these are not Hallmark card creatures. These are extremely powerful entities.
74,00:06:52.700,00:06:57.700,5.0, Angels often get depicted in artwork with wings.
75,00:06:57.700,00:07:05.700,8.0, Now the Ark of the Covenant does have two cherubim depicted with wings over the mercy seat.
76,00:07:05.700,00:07:14.700,9.0," But, key term here, these angels are representing the cherubim at the throne of God in heaven."
77,00:07:14.700,00:07:22.700,8.0, But I can't find one spot in the entirety of the Greek or Hebrew biblical texts
78,00:07:22.700,00:07:34.700,12.0," where angels, dimensional beings, Beneha Elohim, stepping through into this reality had wings."
79,00:07:34.700,00:07:39.700,5.0," From the angels at the tomb of Jesus Christ, no wings."
80,00:07:39.700,00:07:44.700,5.0," All the way back to Genesis, to the angels that visited Abraham,"
81,00:07:44.700,00:07:50.700,6.0," to the angel that dropped the chains from Peter's wrists and said,"
82,00:07:50.700,00:07:53.700,3.0, Get up and come with me.
83,00:07:53.700,00:08:03.700,10.0," Every iron locked door opening before their path and soldiers seeming to fall by the wayside, unconscious."
84,00:08:03.700,00:08:08.700,5.0, Peter had some clout with someone somewhere that night.
85,00:08:08.700,00:08:17.700,9.0, The soldiers that had fallen asleep woke up to be executed the very next day.
86,00:08:17.700,00:08:22.700,5.0, The truth is there are wealths of these throughout the text.
87,00:08:22.700,00:08:29.700,7.0, The helping hand that seems to arrive in extremely particular moments
88,00:08:29.700,00:08:33.700,4.0, when all hope might otherwise seem lost.
89,00:08:33.700,00:08:41.700,8.0, Or messengers appearing to announce highly specific events in human history.
90,00:08:41.700,00:08:46.700,5.0, Events and moments that would change everything.
91,00:08:46.700,00:08:55.700,9.0," You know, it almost reads like someone sort of guided how all this comes out."
92,00:08:55.700,00:09:04.700,9.0, One of the most stunning discoveries of the 20th century is that the entirety of the universe is finite.
93,00:09:04.700,00:09:08.700,4.0, That's actually extremely powerful knowledge.
94,00:09:08.700,00:09:17.700,9.0," Reality can appear solid, but in truth, it's 99.9% empty space."
95,00:09:17.700,00:09:27.700,10.0," The base framework of reality itself at the deepest quantum level is not made of matter,"
96,00:09:27.700,00:09:36.700,9.0, but of little statistical probabilities appearing wherever they need to appear next.
97,00:09:36.700,00:09:49.700,13.0, Even the majestic ticking minutes of time itself are quantized at 10 to the negative 43 seconds.
98,00:09:49.700,00:10:00.700,11.0, And every single three-dimensional particle pixel of this place is not random.
99,00:10:00.700,00:10:05.700,5.0," In fact, they're 10 to the negative 33 centimeters."
100,00:10:05.700,00:10:08.700,3.0, The fabric of reality is finite.
101,00:10:08.700,00:10:12.700,4.0, Almost like a pure data live stream.
102,00:10:12.700,00:10:14.700,2.0, And it's not random.
103,00:10:14.700,00:10:18.700,4.0, That's extremely powerful knowledge.
104,00:10:18.700,00:10:21.700,3.0," It was Albert Einstein who once said,"
105,00:10:21.700,00:10:24.700,3.0, reality is merely an illusion.
106,00:10:24.700,00:10:30.700,6.0," When you hear the physics guys talking about the universe as a hologram,"
107,00:10:30.700,00:10:39.700,9.0," or saying that our reality is a simplified projection of a much more complex reality,"
108,00:10:39.700,00:10:45.700,6.0," or saying that time, space, and matter are synthetic,"
109,00:10:45.700,00:10:50.700,5.0, I don't know if I like the term projection. It seems far too limiting.
110,00:10:50.700,00:11:00.700,10.0," Or mathematicians who might say that the whole place appears to be a product of mathematics,"
111,00:11:00.700,00:11:06.700,6.0, which our mathematics are extremely inadequate to describe.
112,00:11:06.700,00:11:16.700,10.0, It is true that a created thing can never understand the full scope of who created it.
113,00:11:16.700,00:11:28.700,12.0, The bottom line that this place is couched in a much larger spiritual and dimensional reality.
114,00:11:28.700,00:11:32.700,4.0, These are the words of Paul when writing to the Hebrews.
115,00:11:32.700,00:11:41.700,9.0," Do not forget to entertain strangers, for some have entertained angels unaware."
116,00:11:41.700,00:11:49.700,8.0," How can a spiritual being, an angel, or even a whole set of fallen angels,"
117,00:11:49.700,00:11:55.700,6.0, give actual birth to its own genetic line of anomalies?
118,00:11:55.700,00:12:04.700,9.0," How can something spiritual, dimensional, interact with something physical?"
119,00:12:04.700,00:12:09.700,5.0, I'm not sure that the lines are quite that black and white.
120,00:12:09.700,00:12:14.700,5.0," It was Jude, the half-brother of Jesus Christ."
121,00:12:14.700,00:12:20.700,6.0," Mind you, this comes right before Jude quotes from Enoch 1.9."
122,00:12:20.700,00:12:29.700,9.0," Enoch would be the seventh from Adam, the great-grandfather of Noah in the book of Genesis."
123,00:12:29.700,00:12:37.700,8.0," Genesis 5.24, and Enoch was not, for God took him."
124,00:12:37.700,00:12:39.700,2.0, God really liked Enoch.
125,00:12:39.700,00:12:48.700,9.0," And so Jude is saying, even the angels, which kept not their first estate."
126,00:12:48.700,00:12:52.700,4.0, Angels there is talking about fallen angels.
127,00:12:52.700,00:12:58.700,6.0, The term kept not their first estate has a dual meaning in that sentence.
128,00:12:58.700,00:13:07.700,9.0," Not just that they left the heavens, but their physical bodies for earthly flesh and material bodies."
129,00:13:07.700,00:13:17.700,10.0," Jude continues, but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains"
130,00:13:17.700,00:13:22.700,5.0, under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
131,00:13:22.700,00:13:26.700,4.0," These are actual fragments from the book of Enoch,"
132,00:13:26.700,00:13:37.700,11.0," found in the caves of Qumran in Israel, dating anywhere between 100 to 400 BC."
133,00:13:37.700,00:13:43.700,6.0, And of course the most famous document and record to come out of those caves
134,00:13:43.700,00:13:51.700,8.0," was this actual image of a scroll of Isaiah found in those caves,"
135,00:13:51.700,00:13:55.700,4.0, which had scholars literally holding their breath
136,00:13:55.700,00:14:01.700,6.0, until they found out that every single word has an exact precision
137,00:14:01.700,00:14:05.700,4.0, matching our current text that is uncanny.
138,00:14:05.700,00:14:13.700,8.0," This applies to all of the Hebrew texts, by the way, even the Greek Jewish texts."
139,00:14:13.700,00:14:20.700,7.0, The fragments from the book of Enoch matched up perfectly with copies found
140,00:14:20.700,00:14:28.700,8.0, by explorer James Bruce in Complete Ethiopian Bibles in 1773.
141,00:14:28.700,00:14:34.700,6.0, The book of Enoch is divided into five sections.
142,00:14:34.700,00:14:37.700,3.0," It's in the Book of the Watchers, where the book..."
143,00:14:37.700,00:14:47.220,9.520000457763672," of the Qumran fragments come from, then Enoch is telling you that a set of 200 fallen angels"
144,00:14:47.220,00:14:51.580,4.359999656677246, made physical entrance to this place.
145,00:14:51.580,00:14:59.300,7.720000267028809," This would have been prior to the flood of Noah, as Enoch was the great-grandfather of"
146,00:14:59.300,00:15:00.300,1.0, Noah.
147,00:15:00.300,00:15:05.900,5.600000381469727," In fact, this would have been more than a thousand years before Noah, as Methuselah,"
148,00:15:05.900,00:15:13.900,8.0," the longest living man ever recorded in the biblical text, lived 969 years."
149,00:15:13.900,00:15:23.420,9.520000457763672," If you do the math on it, Methuselah actually died the very year, or seven days, before"
150,00:15:23.420,00:15:24.420,1.0, the flood.
151,00:15:24.420,00:15:34.500,10.079998016357422," Curiously, the name Methuselah means, his death shall bring, or perhaps more precisely,"

153,00:15:38.260,00:15:46.560,8.299999237060547," Speaking of strange skulls, skulls like this one here are what the archeological community"

155,00:15:56.060,00:15:57.660,1.5999984741210938, on the screen here.

157,00:16:05.420,00:16:13.180,7.760002136230469, Monkeys and humans are grandly different in their bone structures.

164,00:16:57.340,00:17:02.500,5.160003662109375," Or the more commonly used terminology, there are no missing links."
165,00:17:02.500,00:17:07.340,4.839996337890625," This doesn't come as terribly surprising to me, because genetically speaking, within the"

173,00:17:48.960,00:17:55.660,6.6999969482421875," its actual DNA, is losing coding over time."
174,00:17:55.660,00:17:58.760,3.0999908447265625," It's weakening, deteriorating."
175,00:17:58.760,00:18:08.280,9.520004272460938," It's not just animal species that we are systematically and slowly losing, not gaining, in the order"

180,00:18:36.460,00:18:43.540,7.0800018310546875, The same as would happen as if you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy
181,00:18:43.540,00:18:50.420,6.8799896240234375," of anything, you're going to see it weaken, not strengthen."
182,00:18:50.420,00:18:59.180,8.760009765625," A Neanderthal skeleton and skull is absolutely identical to a modern human, except for a"
183,00:18:59.180,00:19:01.300,2.1199951171875, few key features.
184,00:19:01.300,00:19:06.400,5.100006103515625," The bones are thicker, stronger, more fit."
185,00:19:06.400,00:19:10.800,4.399993896484375, Also the wisdom teeth down here fit absolutely perfectly.
186,00:19:10.800,00:19:15.200,4.399993896484375, These thick brows can vary in size from skull to skull.
187,00:19:15.200,00:19:23.000,7.800018310546875," A small detail that a lot of people may not know, the human brow of any individual, this"
188,00:19:23.000,00:19:30.480,7.47998046875," bone right up here, continues to grow just ever so slightly through the entirety of a"

191,00:19:37.880,00:19:45.040,7.160003662109375," So if you were to live two or three or four or five hundred years, then that much larger"
192,00:19:45.040,00:19:55.400,10.360015869140625, brow that you see indenting up right there is precisely how your skull would look.
193,00:19:55.400,00:20:03.600,8.199981689453125," When we peer back in history to our oldest written texts, we're finding redundant accounts"
194,00:20:03.600,00:20:07.080,3.480010986328125, of very long lifespans.
195,00:20:07.080,00:20:13.200,6.1199951171875," In the biblical texts, most absolutely and definitely in the Sumerian kings list, as"
196,00:20:13.200,00:20:21.240,8.040008544921875, well as records covering what amounts to little more than settlements following the great
197,00:20:21.240,00:20:30.560,9.32000732421875," flood as is recorded here in the Epic of Gilgamesh, along with the extended lifespans,"
198,00:20:30.560,00:20:36.320,5.759979248046875, both before and briefly after the flood.
199,00:20:36.320,00:20:42.280,5.96002197265625, This is the oldest written epic in the entire world.
200,00:20:42.280,00:20:51.520,9.239990234375," The actual records of King Gilgamesh of Uruk, one of the first kings following the great"
201,00:20:51.520,00:20:52.840,1.32000732421875, flood.
202,00:20:52.840,00:20:59.900,7.05999755859375, These Neanderthal skulls have varying sizes of large brows.
203,00:20:59.900,00:21:07.520,7.6199951171875," In short, what you're looking at with these Neanderthal skulls is eerily identical to"
204,00:21:07.520,00:21:18.120,10.600006103515625, what a human being would look like if they were much more fit than we are today and had
205,00:21:18.120,00:21:24.020,5.899993896484375, lived varying amounts of hundreds and hundreds of years.
206,00:21:24.020,00:21:32.200,8.17999267578125," From a genetic perspective, no one actually knows what causes death or initiates the death"
207,00:21:32.200,00:21:40.160,7.96002197265625," process, capping us out in anywhere between 100 and 120 years."
208,00:21:40.160,00:21:44.720,4.55999755859375, Almost as if someone flicked a switch off inside the coding.
209,00:21:44.720,00:21:53.360,8.639984130859375, Every single cell in your entire body is programmed to regenerate and renew itself.
210,00:21:53.360,00:22:05.080,11.720001220703125," But when dealing with the topic of the Nephilim, we are by no means talking about elongated"
211,00:22:05.080,00:22:13.840,8.760009765625," years and larger brows, stronger bodies and wisdom teeth that fit perfect like a glove."
212,00:22:13.840,00:22:19.240,5.399993896484375, The extremely long years resting on the large brow of the forehead.
213,00:22:19.240,00:22:25.640,6.399993896484375, Nor are we fiddling around with old monkey bones.
214,00:22:25.640,00:22:32.360,6.720001220703125," The truth, however, is that there are a lot of human-esque bones on this planet which"
215,00:22:32.360,00:22:41.160,8.800018310546875," can very easily, even to trained experts, blur the lines between was it human or was"
216,00:22:41.160,00:22:42.880,1.720001220703125, it something else.
217,00:22:42.880,00:22:48.280,5.399993896484375, Now there are a lot of tribes that have done varieties of things to their bodies to achieve
218,00:22:48.280,00:22:53.920,5.639984130859375, a number of different effects including the binding of the skull to produce this elongated
219,00:22:53.920,00:22:56.700,2.779998779296875, shape on the back of the head.
220,00:22:56.700,00:23:05.360,8.660003662109375," There are some significant differences, however, between even the best of clearly modified"
221,00:23:05.360,00:23:13.000,7.639984130859375, skulls like this skull on the screen here and skulls that appear significantly larger
222,00:23:13.000,00:23:22.000,9.0," and much more naturally formed than that, like this actual elongated skull being compared"
223,00:23:22.000,00:23:29.080,7.08001708984375, against the bust of either Nefertiti or Akhenaten's daughter.
224,00:23:29.080,00:23:37.320,8.239990234375, Leading many to ask if these tribesmen originally began binding babies' heads in an attempt
225,00:23:37.320,00:23:46.400,9.08001708984375," to copy something that was perhaps a whole lot larger in scope, like this actual skull"
226,00:23:46.400,00:23:48.600,2.20001220703125, found in Peru.
227,00:23:48.600,00:23:53.240,4.6400146484375," Some of these are just absolutely massive and there are hundreds and hundreds of them,"
228,00:23:53.240,00:24:00.040,6.79998779296875," wildly massive, including children that already have the features."
229,00:24:00.040,00:24:06.920,6.8800048828125, One of the first red flags that you're dealing with something that is incredibly strange
230,00:24:06.920,00:24:19.520,12.5999755859375, is that the actual head volume of the elongated skull is at least 25% larger in its head volume
231,00:24:19.520,00:24:24.119,4.5999755859375, than a regular human or even an old human skull.
232,00:24:24.119,00:24:27.040,2.9200439453125, These are in fact quite different.
233,00:24:27.040,00:24:34.360,7.32000732421875," But it's not just that they absolutely have to be enormously massive, there's another"
234,00:24:34.360,00:24:42.360,8.0, difference on just the skulls themselves which is even more puzzling than that.
235,00:24:42.360,00:24:51.920,9.55999755859375, Every human skull on every single human being should have these two plates in the back of
236,00:24:51.920,00:25:00.040,8.1199951171875, the skull that are clearly divided between the two of them by this crease running towards
237,00:25:00.040,00:25:01.800,1.760009765625, the back of the head.
238,00:25:01.800,00:25:09.119,7.3199462890625," This elongated skull, however, is not like that with the crease and the two plates in"
239,00:25:09.119,00:25:10.600,1.48004150390625, the back.
240,00:25:10.600,00:25:19.420,8.82000732421875," This skull has one long crease, very defined here, a crease coming back this way, and one"
241,00:25:19.420,00:25:23.000,3.5799560546875, very large skull cap.
242,00:25:23.000,00:25:29.960,6.96002197265625, Binding a little baby's head should most certainly not change the genetic bone structure.
243,00:25:29.960,00:25:34.160,4.20001220703125, But it's not just elongated heads we're talking about.
244,00:25:34.160,00:25:43.440,9.280029296875, We're also talking about giants like this Thailand image holding the enormous sword
245,00:25:43.440,00:25:48.760,5.32000732421875, and the two fangs or tusks coming out of the mouth.
246,00:25:48.760,00:25:55.760,7.0, Now I do believe that's a Babylonian Ishtar right there depicted as a circular disk which
247,00:25:55.760,00:26:03.760,8.0, these three gentlemen are bringing before this very large character.
248,00:26:03.760,00:26:14.880,11.1199951171875," Babylon, particularly ancient Babylon, plays perhaps a critical role in all this."
249,00:26:14.880,00:26:20.320,5.44000244140625, Just second down from Babylon would be Egypt.
250,00:26:20.320,00:26:26.560,6.239990234375, After the Hebrews were in the wilderness during the time of the tabernacle and about
251,00:26:26.560,00:26:33.560,7.0," to enter the promised land, in Numbers 13.33 it says this,"
252,00:26:33.560,00:26:44.280,10.72003173828125," And there we saw the giants, the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who were of the giants,"
253,00:26:44.280,00:26:49.760,5.47998046875, and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers before them.
254,00:26:49.760,00:26:57.560,7.79998779296875," Now there are some tribes where God told the Hebrews, just conquer the people."
255,00:26:57.560,00:27:04.360,6.800048828125," And then there are other tribes where God specified, wipe them all out."
256,00:27:04.360,00:27:07.800,3.44000244140625, As if there's some type of a gene pool problem.
257,00:27:07.800,00:27:15.480,7.67999267578125," As is in the case of the Canaanites, the Raphites, the Ammonites, all of which are listed as"
258,00:27:15.480,00:27:16.480,1.0, giants.
259,00:27:16.480,00:27:23.840,7.3599853515625," And then you've got other types of tribes, like for example, the Amalekites."
260,00:27:23.840,00:27:28.280,4.44000244140625, The first part of Amalekite means people.
261,00:27:28.280,00:27:36.440,8.1600341796875," The second part of Amalekite, it's an ancient word in Semitic languages that means vampire-like"
262,00:27:36.440,00:27:37.440,1.0, demon.
263,00:27:37.440,00:27:44.880,7.44000244140625," These Amalekites were not human, and a lot of people believe that this is where the vampire"
264,00:27:44.880,00:27:47.680,2.79998779296875, legends came from in Romania.
265,00:27:47.680,00:27:53.680,6.0, And I'm sure the Israelites well knew this by looking at them.
266,00:27:53.680,00:28:00.080,6.4000244140625," I mean, if the Amalekites are considered a vampire-like demon, you know, I'm sure they"
267,00:28:00.080,00:28:01.920,1.8399658203125, probably had the features.
268,00:28:01.920,00:28:13.280,11.3599853515625," Deuteronomy 3.11, Only King Og of Bashan the giant was left remaining of the Raphites,"
269,00:28:13.280,00:28:18.080,4.800048828125," the Ammonites, or so the Hebrews believed."
270,00:28:18.080,00:28:26.920,8.8399658203125," But the truth is, giants have been reported in archaeological finds all across the globe,"
271,00:28:26.920,00:28:36.080,9.1600341796875," particularly in the United States, which is what most every one of these news articles"
272,00:28:36.080,00:28:40.560,4.47998046875, right here going down the screen are about.
273,00:28:40.560,00:28:44.440,3.8800048828125, Many of them from the New York Times.
274,00:28:44.440,00:28:53.240,8.79998779296875," Some bones are still available, however, like this actual image of a jawbone recovered from"
275,00:28:53.240,00:29:03.440,10.20001220703125, a giant skeleton in Nevada that's being compared to a human jawbone on the screen.
276,00:29:03.440,00:29:08.380,4.94000244140625, How large do you think that skeleton actually was?
277,00:29:08.380,00:29:13.100,4.72003173828125, Or the Indian legend of the red-headed giants.

350,00:37:21.880,00:37:27.880,6.0, Look at the size of that whale buried in that desert there.
351,00:37:27.880,00:37:37.720,9.839996337890625, Planet and animals are found buried and fossilized in every single layer and strata of the top
352,00:37:37.720,00:37:40.720,3.0, layers of the earth.
353,00:37:40.720,00:37:50.240,9.52001953125, Creatures of every possible kind of animal that we see every day are found mixed in underneath
354,00:37:50.240,00:37:58.080,7.839996337890625," the earth, along with mammoth sized creatures, which don't seem to be around anymore."
355,00:37:58.080,00:38:05.840,7.760009765625," And these animals of every genre and flavor are often found in mass graveyards, like this"

358,00:38:20.360,00:38:30.160,9.800048828125," Strangely, when dealing with strata, it is sifted by sediments exactly as one would expect."
359,00:38:30.160,00:38:39.160,9.0, There were a lot of water pumping around on the surface of the ground.
360,00:38:39.160,00:38:47.360,8.20001220703125, One of the enormous challenges of dating anything is that you have to know what the pre-existing
361,00:38:47.360,00:38:50.280,2.91998291015625, conditions were.
362,00:38:50.280,00:38:57.800,7.52001953125," For example, this dragonfly fossilized on the screen here has a two and a half foot"

364,00:39:01.520,00:39:06.920,5.4000244140625, Dragonflies take in perfectly the amount of oxygen that they need to fly.
365,00:39:06.920,00:39:13.040,6.1199951171875," If one were to assume that atmospheric conditions, oxygen levels and carbon levels in the past"
366,00:39:13.040,00:39:20.520,7.47998046875," were like this, when they were actually way up here like this, that would indeed pump"
367,00:39:20.520,00:39:27.080,6.55999755859375, out numbers that were very large all across the board.
368,00:39:27.080,00:39:36.440,9.3599853515625, This dragonfly on the screen could not lift up off the ground and fly today.
369,00:39:36.440,00:39:45.000,8.55999755859375, We find extremely high oxygen levels in little bitty air bubbles trapped in ancient tree
370,00:39:45.000,00:39:46.000,1.0, sap.
371,00:39:46.000,00:39:50.840,4.84002685546875," Even buried in common things that we might not think about, look at the size of this"
372,00:39:50.840,00:39:59.080,8.239990234375," modern day elephant in comparison to this giant animal here, a bronchiosaurus."
373,00:39:59.080,00:40:07.200,8.1199951171875, Much of this stuff requires an entirely different and much more lush environment.
374,00:40:07.200,00:40:15.760,8.55999755859375, This elephant is about the size in girth as the base of the neck of this animal.
375,00:40:15.760,00:40:23.040,7.280029296875, Bronchiosaurus would have a terribly difficult time lifting its body today.
376,00:40:23.040,00:40:30.680,7.6400146484375, And that is but one tiny example of an Everest sized mountain of thousands.
377,00:40:30.680,00:40:40.920,10.239990234375, The most common method of dating in this present day is using fossils to date geological layers
378,00:40:40.920,00:40:45.440,4.51995849609375, and using geological layers to date fossils.
379,00:40:45.440,00:40:47.820,2.3800048828125, Some would call this circular reasoning.
380,00:40:47.820,00:40:54.540,6.72003173828125," One thing that I find fascinating, not only are there mass burials of animals underground,"
381,00:40:54.540,00:41:00.700,6.15997314453125, but there are mass burials of trees going all sorts of different directions.
382,00:41:00.700,00:41:05.100,4.4000244140625," Some of them, interestingly enough, going vertical."
383,00:41:05.100,00:41:10.980,5.8800048828125, What this means is that you would have trees that would have had to have been standing
384,00:41:10.980,00:41:21.540,10.55999755859375, up for millions of years while the layers of strata form around the tree.
385,00:41:21.540,00:41:30.820,9.27996826171875, No one really knows how many of these there actually are buried all over the place underneath
386,00:41:30.820,00:41:32.320,1.5, the ground.
387,00:41:32.320,00:41:36.820,4.5, This is believed to be the oldest living tree on earth.
388,00:41:36.820,00:41:48.460,11.6400146484375," Its name is Methuselah and its age is believed to be 4,840 years old, give or take, which"
389,00:41:48.460,00:41:55.740,7.280029296875, is interesting because if you're using the Septuagint or the Masoretic texts and even
390,00:41:55.740,00:42:02.820,7.0799560546875," using Gilgamesh as well as the Sumerian Kings list as a reference point, you're going to"
391,00:42:02.820,00:42:12.760,9.94000244140625," come up with a flood date a pinch more than 3,000 BC, maybe a few hundred years more."
392,00:42:12.760,00:42:17.100,4.34002685546875, And old Methuselah would have been born just a little bit afterwards.
393,00:42:17.100,00:42:24.380,7.27996826171875," I wasn't there, but I know this, that enormous whales really should not be turning up in"
394,00:42:24.380,00:42:33.060,8.6800537109375, deserts and thousands and thousands and thousands of seashells should not be backpacking through
395,00:42:33.060,00:42:35.300,2.239990234375, the Himalayas.
396,00:42:35.300,00:42:45.060,9.760009765625, Trees don't generally stand up for tens or hundreds or millions of years while layers
397,00:42:45.060,00:42:47.900,2.8399658203125, of sediments build up around them.
398,00:42:47.900,00:42:53.860,5.96002197265625, I'm thinking that maybe a real big flood did it.
399,00:42:53.860,00:43:01.380,7.51995849609375," Occasionally I'll hear commentators state that ancient India is tens and tens, sometimes"
400,00:43:01.380,00:43:05.700,4.32000732421875, even hundreds of thousands of years old.
401,00:43:05.700,00:43:11.900,6.20001220703125, And I've tried to chase the rabbit trails on what they mean by that.
402,00:43:11.900,00:43:13.300,1.4000244140625, It's not just India.
403,00:43:13.300,00:43:24.140,10.8399658203125," You'll find this pulling dates out of thin blue sky, particularly in media stuff, a lot."
404,00:43:24.140,00:43:26.540,2.4000244140625, I can't find what they're referencing.
405,00:43:26.540,00:43:37.900,11.3599853515625, The empire of India began following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC.
406,00:43:37.900,00:43:45.780,7.8800048828125," You begin to see the rise of the first empire of India, the Muryan dynasty."
407,00:43:45.780,00:43:55.820,10.03997802734375," Going back even further into the far east, the rise of the first dynasty of ancient China,"
408,00:43:55.820,00:44:07.780,11.96002197265625," the Xia dynasty, its inception at 2000 BC, bringing us full circle to our first empires,"
409,00:44:07.780,00:44:14.020,6.239990234375," which would rise right down here in Mesopotamia, where Babylon would become, and the ancient"
410,00:44:14.020,00:44:25.140,11.1199951171875," city of ancient Uruk, where Gilgamesh ruled, land of the star, which is rested inside of"
411,00:44:25.140,00:44:35.100,9.96002197265625," the crescent, Babylon and Egypt, the two opening players of occult empires."
412,00:44:35.100,00:44:44.100,9.0," right after the flood, and then dropping down right over here, following alongside the Nile"
413,00:44:44.100,00:44:52.860,8.760000228881836," River banks, where Egypt would become, and where step pyramids and the first attempts"
414,00:44:52.860,00:44:57.620,4.760000228881836, at actual pyramids would begin to rise.
415,00:44:57.620,00:45:12.420,14.799999237060547," Under Djoser, in the third dynasty of Egypt, about 2600 BC, land of the Eye of Horus, and"
416,00:45:12.420,00:45:25.460,13.040000915527344," disk between the horns of the most ancient, Hathor, both stretches of land dropping down"
417,00:45:25.460,00:45:36.780,11.319999694824219," along the Fertile Land, the so-called Cradle of Civilization, where little bitty settlements"
418,00:45:36.780,00:45:45.420,8.639999389648438," would begin to take shape, with your first tiny fortified cities like Uruk, in roughly"
419,00:45:45.420,00:45:51.140,5.720001220703125, 2900 to 3000 BC.
420,00:45:51.140,00:46:02.300,11.159996032714844," Coincidentally, both newly developing locations dropping down from right up here in the same"
421,00:46:02.300,00:46:09.100,6.8000030517578125, area where the boat that saved all mankind is said to have landed.
422,00:46:09.100,00:46:17.780,8.680000305175781, So those 200 angels covered by Enoch prior to the flood does not represent all of the
423,00:46:17.780,00:46:20.340,2.55999755859375, fallen angels that there are.
424,00:46:20.340,00:46:26.440,6.099998474121094," It represents a small portion of the total number of fallen angels, the ones which made"
425,00:46:26.440,00:46:33.980,7.540000915527344," entrance to this place, came in, and interbred with human beings."
426,00:46:33.980,00:46:43.540,9.560005187988281," This created all sorts of little uglies and unfriendlies, including the giants."
427,00:46:43.540,00:46:51.020,7.4799957275390625, There's also indications in the text that this wasn't necessarily voluntary.
428,00:46:51.020,00:46:58.220,7.1999969482421875," What some of your oldest pages and little bitty scribbles on earth, including Enoch,"
429,00:46:58.220,00:47:07.260,9.040008544921875," in full detail, are telling you is that before that flood, something unfriendly made entrance"
430,00:47:07.260,00:47:15.020,7.7599945068359375," to this place, and was genetically breeding itself, creating its own offspring, turning"
431,00:47:15.020,00:47:24.620,9.600006103515625," mankind into a blood-bathed circus of its own unimaginable and twisted design, spreading"
432,00:47:24.620,00:47:33.900,9.279998779296875," like a virus generation after generation after generation for more than a thousand years,"
433,00:47:33.900,00:47:42.260,8.360000610351562," until the flood came along, wiping the slate clean, taking everything back down to zero."
434,00:47:42.260,00:47:51.820,9.55999755859375," But then afterwards, another little bitty door opened, and perhaps what was in the past"
435,00:47:51.820,00:48:00.020,8.199996948242188, might slowly creep its way back in for a final show.
436,00:48:00.020,00:48:08.380,8.360000610351562, It's my extremely strong opinion that the bulk of the hundreds of truly strange bones
437,00:48:08.380,00:48:17.340,8.960006713867188, and enormous skulls unlike man in this video came after the ancient flood.
438,00:48:17.340,00:48:25.460,8.1199951171875," Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward."
439,00:48:25.460,00:48:31.780,6.32000732421875," Genesis 6, 4, breeding generations."
440,00:48:31.780,00:48:40.220,8.44000244140625, Look at the scope of the size of this child's head.
441,00:48:40.220,00:48:43.660,3.4399871826171875, And then breeding even more generations.
442,00:48:43.660,00:48:54.940,11.280014038085938," The size of the eye sockets are enormous, moving up this large skull, and then dropping"
443,00:48:54.940,00:49:00.140,5.199981689453125, down to breed some more generations.
444,00:49:00.140,00:49:08.940,8.800018310546875," And here's another little baby one, and then breeding even more than that."
445,00:49:08.940,00:49:20.740,11.79998779296875, And look at the eye sockets in comparison to the size of the skull atop that tiny skeleton.
446,00:49:20.740,00:49:33.340,12.600006103515625," Enoch 7, 3, and when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and began"
447,00:49:33.340,00:49:36.700,3.3599853515625, to devour mankind.
448,00:49:36.700,00:49:40.540,3.84002685546875, It really is absolutely astounding.
449,00:49:40.540,00:49:50.940,10.399993896484375, It's almost impossible to believe that what you're looking at really is real.
450,00:49:50.940,00:49:56.820,5.8800048828125, This one commonly gets called the Royal Redhead.
451,00:49:56.820,00:50:10.340,13.519989013671875," A special thank you to Brian Forrester, as well as his team in Paracas, Peru for making"
452,00:50:10.340,00:50:18.700,8.3599853515625," the footage, as well as the elongated skulls seen in this video available."
453,00:50:18.700,00:50:23.180,4.480010986328125, That is one strange head.
454,00:50:23.180,00:50:32.180,9.0," Enoch continues, and they began to sin against the birds and the beasts and the reptiles"
455,00:50:32.180,00:50:33.580,1.4000244140625, and the fish.
456,00:50:33.580,00:50:43.460,9.8800048828125," I have absolutely no idea exactly what that means, but it doesn't sound good."
457,00:50:43.460,00:50:49.800,6.339996337890625, And to devour one another's flesh and drink the very blood.
458,00:50:49.800,00:50:58.440,8.639984130859375," It is curious that whether in a biological or a spiritual sense that is equally as deep,"
459,00:50:58.440,00:51:06.600,8.160003662109375," if not deeper, than even the mysterious thing that we call consciousness, which seems in"
460,00:51:06.600,00:51:17.640,11.040008544921875," a very real way to plug us in to reality at all, there's always something uniquely special"
461,00:51:17.640,00:51:19.560,1.91998291015625, about the blood.
462,00:51:19.560,00:51:24.840,5.279998779296875," There's an interesting verse that we've all heard in Leviticus 17, 14."
463,00:51:24.840,00:51:27.240,2.4000244140625, You've heard it a million times.
464,00:51:27.240,00:51:32.040,4.79998779296875, The life of all flesh is in the blood.
465,00:51:32.040,00:51:39.480,7.44000244140625, The real word is actually saying the rock of every sort of flesh that's provided.
466,00:51:39.480,00:51:45.800,6.32000732421875," Saying the spirit of the flesh is in its blood, not the life."
467,00:51:45.800,00:51:49.640,3.839996337890625," That is being not a poor translation, but a mistranslation."
468,00:51:49.640,00:51:58.760,9.1199951171875," It is important to note that after death, the blood is no longer usable."
469,00:51:58.760,00:52:01.320,2.55999755859375, As if it's lost something.
470,00:52:01.320,00:52:12.360,11.040008544921875, Every living organism on this planet is constructed of three-dimensional digital coding.
471,00:52:12.360,00:52:20.360,8.0," Like zip files, pure data, zero junk code in every single strand."
472,00:52:20.360,00:52:23.240,2.8800048828125," Tip for tat, line for line."
473,00:52:23.240,00:52:32.360,9.1199951171875, Which opens up click by click by click to become a living biological organism.
474,00:52:32.360,00:52:36.200,3.839996337890625, All of it fitting together like a perfect glove.
475,00:52:36.200,00:52:45.400,9.20001220703125," Deeper inside the genome, the framework of pure biological software and precision operating"
476,00:52:45.400,00:52:47.000,1.600006103515625, system.
477,00:52:47.000,00:52:56.600,9.5999755859375," File folders containing actual body plans, digital instructions coordinating every strand,"
478,00:52:56.600,00:53:06.440,9.84002685546875," every cell, every little bitty part, pulling the molecular fabric of every piece together"
479,00:53:06.440,00:53:12.200,5.760009765625, to create a biological masterpiece.
480,00:53:12.200,00:53:24.840,12.63995361328125," Literally written, birthed into reality itself from scratch and seemingly plugged in to neurologically"
481,00:53:24.840,00:53:35.880,11.03997802734375, and consciously control every single system of the entire biological masterpiece.
482,00:53:35.880,00:53:44.760,8.8800048828125," It's not just consciousness, the intangible controlling the tangible, which is a paradox."
483,00:53:44.760,00:53:57.640,12.87994384765625, The living blueprint for what you call you is alive in every single drop of your blood.
484,00:53:57.640,00:54:04.280,6.6400146484375, One could quite easily come to believe that there's something a lot larger in scope going
485,00:54:04.280,00:54:05.280,1.0, on here.
486,00:54:05.280,00:54:18.080,12.79998779296875, It does say in Genesis 126 that God himself created mankind in his own image and likeness.
487,00:54:18.080,00:54:20.560,2.48004150390625, It's a powerful statement.
488,00:54:20.560,00:54:25.920,5.3599853515625, When you're dealing with the ancient past or things which may even boggle the minds
489,00:54:25.920,00:54:36.800,10.8800048828125," of trained physicians, let no detail, no matter how seemingly trite, slip through the fingertips"
490,00:54:36.800,00:54:44.400,7.5999755859375, to truly understand Babylon and the time periods lasting to this modern age.
491,00:54:44.400,00:54:49.440,5.0400390625, The more recent past from which these skulls likely come.
492,00:54:49.440,00:54:58.560,9.1199951171875, One could easily make an extremely strong case that we are merely infants running loose
493,00:54:58.560,00:55:10.480,11.91998291015625," in very short term, little bodies, biological machines through which we peer out consciously"
494,00:55:10.480,00:55:16.080,5.5999755859375," into this thing that we call the material world, built and constructed right out of"
495,00:55:16.080,00:55:22.960,6.8800048828125," thin air by digital coding, light years more sophisticated in each and every single strand"
496,00:55:22.960,00:55:29.040,6.08001708984375, than all of the computer software made by man combined all the way back to the very
497,00:55:29.040,00:55:30.320,1.280029296875, first computer.
498,00:55:30.320,00:55:38.560,8.239990234375," What the pages of Enoch are saying, as well as the Hebrew texts and cultures all across"
499,00:55:38.560,00:55:48.000,9.44000244140625," this globe, is that something has tried to plug itself in and insert itself into all of that."
500,00:55:48.000,00:55:57.040,9.03997802734375, Enoch is not just talking about a set of very dark fallen beings and producing their own
501,00:55:57.040,00:56:00.240,3.20001220703125, hybrid children.
502,00:56:00.240,00:56:02.960,2.719970703125, It goes a lot deeper than that.
503,00:56:02.960,00:56:09.840,6.8800048828125," What he's telling you is that these fallen angels which produced the Nephilim, neither"
504,00:56:09.840,00:56:17.360,7.52001953125," completely angel or completely human, but something in between."
505,00:56:17.360,00:56:23.520,6.15997314453125," So what he's literally saying is when they die, their souls come out from the race of"
506,00:56:23.520,00:56:30.480,6.96002197265625," giants that came from this union, gave way to a brood of evil spirits, and those are"
507,00:56:30.480,00:56:33.840,3.3599853515625," the foul spirits of the earth, the demons."
508,00:56:33.840,00:56:42.880,9.03997802734375," The Nephilim die, they become or get added to the number of demons, beings which later"
509,00:56:42.880,00:56:53.840,10.96002197265625," cultures would call the underworld gods, the shadow creatures from all of the ages of history."
510,00:56:53.840,00:57:00.960,7.1199951171875, Beings and creatures that can possibly bleed through from a realm that might be just as
511,00:57:00.960,00:57:05.920,4.96002197265625, close as the air between your fingertips.
512,00:57:05.920,00:57:11.520,5.5999755859375," Now it is always eggs and semen that things like this are after, right?"
513,00:57:11.520,00:57:13.440,1.91998291015625, Or be summonsed.
514,00:57:13.440,00:57:16.800,3.36004638671875, Notice the little baby down there in the image.
515,00:57:16.800,00:57:23.360,6.55999755859375, There's a big part of me that thinks that that thing there might not ultimately want
516,00:57:23.360,00:57:24.640,1.27996826171875, to be friends.
517,00:57:24.640,00:57:30.480,5.84002685546875," Almost like whatever it is, it's close enough it can see you."
518,00:57:30.480,00:57:34.400,3.91998291015625," Enoch used the term, the watchers."
519,00:57:34.400,00:57:41.680,7.280029296875," But in terms of evil, the deeper, darker, more twisted and macabre, the better."
520,00:57:41.680,00:57:46.160,4.47998046875, And the higher the place of the carnage.
521,00:57:46.160,00:57:48.080,1.91998291015625, These aren't fallen angels.
522,00:57:48.080,00:57:52.640,4.55999755859375," If he casts them out, the fallen angels can go, they can go to the high places."
523,00:57:52.640,00:57:54.080,1.44000244140625, But these aren't fallen angels.
524,00:57:54.080,00:57:55.680,1.60003662109375, These are demons.
525,00:57:55.680,00:57:57.120,1.44000244140625, These are Raphael.
526,00:57:57.120,00:57:58.400,1.27996826171875, These are dead in the film.

540,00:59:20.480,00:59:26.400,5.91998291015625, a character that Crowley claimed stepped through into physical reality.
541,00:59:26.400,00:59:31.520,5.1199951171875, This entity would ultimately become what Crowley would describe as a spiritual.

543,00:59:40.820,00:59:45.780,4.960000038146973, may find some similarities between Crowley's drawing and thousands if not
544,00:59:45.780,00:59:52.060,6.280000686645508, tens of thousands of other such entities drawn by people from every walk

569,01:02:49.700,01:02:57.860,8.160003662109375," seriously, is that UFOs are interstellar spaceships. With Sir Arthur C. Clarke, or"

571,01:03:04.540,01:03:12.540,8.0, you at least ten steps further down the rabbit hole than that. I have yet to meet
572,01:03:12.540,01:03:19.180,6.6399993896484375," one person who has come out of the occult that does not have, in some cases,"
573,01:03:19.180,01:03:26.260,7.0800018310546875, terrifying and extremely tangible and real accounts to give. I also find it
574,01:03:26.260,01:03:30.900,4.6399993896484375, particularly interesting when I've gotten to sit down with people who have
575,01:03:30.900,01:03:36.900,6.0," had life-after-death experiences, most especially if they were legally dead for any"

578,01:03:45.660,01:03:51.860,6.1999969482421875," experience, some strikingly eerie similarities. These bland, sort of"
579,01:03:51.860,01:03:57.820,5.959991455078125," expressionless, pull-you-in type characters, with sort of varying degrees"
580,01:03:57.820,01:04:06.900,9.08001708984375, of sinister evilness. Described almost like a diminished alternate version of

584,01:04:29.420,01:04:36.060,6.639984130859375, descriptions of the creatures get even worse. Things much more disturbing and
585,01:04:36.060,01:04:43.580,7.52001953125, twisted than what may channel in. To be portrayed as physical artwork and
586,01:04:43.580,01:04:50.980,7.399993896484375, representations of something through the imaginations and the minds of men.
587,01:04:50.980,01:05:00.860,9.8800048828125," Ephesians 2.2, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world."
588,01:05:00.860,01:05:09.580,8.720001220703125," What fascinates me is when people look up and they describe, and the ruler of"

590,01:05:17.340,01:05:26.940,9.600006103515625, who is now at work in the suns of disobedience. Sort of hover in a murky or
591,01:05:26.940,01:05:34.460,7.52001953125," black, dark, scarred horizon. Whether in personal accounts or even in Enoch, you"

593,01:05:41.140,01:05:46.580,5.44000244140625," moving. But diving below, where the people are quickly snatched and drugged to the"
594,01:05:46.580,01:05:52.580,6.0, side by the apparent welcoming teams. They'll talk about a lot of serpents
595,01:05:52.580,01:06:00.820,8.239990234375, ranging from enormous creatures to these more or less human-sized things. Often
596,01:06:00.820,01:06:07.100,6.279998779296875, with man-like or human-like features similar to the wisdom serpents or
597,01:06:07.100,01:06:15.940,8.839996337890625, serpent gods found in every single major ancient culture with uncanny
598,01:06:15.940,01:06:22.540,6.5999755859375, similarities. Look at that big old serpent crawling inside of the crescent
599,01:06:22.540,01:06:29.900,7.360015869140625, shaped moon between the two Babylonian Ishtar stars. I do believe you're gonna
600,01:06:29.900,01:06:37.820,7.920013427734375, find the serpents like the one these three fine fellas are praying to in
601,01:06:37.820,01:06:45.340,7.519989013671875," nearly every belief and religion on earth. The serpents, no matter what size"
602,01:06:45.340,01:06:50.460,5.1199951171875," or shape they're described as, just like any of the other characters within the"
603,01:06:50.460,01:07:00.580,10.1199951171875," place, always have this ancient old one, yet vicious and precise, kind of highly"
604,01:07:00.580,01:07:07.340,6.760009765625, intelligent twist. It's also noteworthy to point out the similarities
605,01:07:07.340,01:07:13.900,6.55999755859375, historically of bones or warped protrusion like horns is in this
606,01:07:13.900,01:07:21.300,7.399993896484375, recreation of Egyptian artwork. Notice the extra set of horns on top is empty
607,01:07:21.300,01:07:27.540,6.239990234375, whereas in this rendering between the horns you've got this little disc
608,01:07:27.540,01:07:33.740,6.20001220703125," resting on top. An environment described at the core of its beating heart,"
609,01:07:33.740,01:07:39.980,6.239990234375, decrepit almost with this vibe of mechanical madness combined with living
610,01:07:39.980,01:07:45.740,5.760009765625, dead organism of tentacles and fangs. What some might have been calling the
611,01:07:45.740,01:07:51.940,6.20001220703125," second heaven, the said diminished realm well beneath heaven and decrepit much"
612,01:07:51.940,01:07:58.220,6.279998779296875, more than the earth. Littered with sophisticated type things in its skies
613,01:07:58.220,01:08:05.300,7.079986572265625," where the fallen angel, Lucifer himself, is said to rule for a short spance."
614,01:08:05.300,01:08:14.460,9.1600341796875, Almost like hitting the show code key to the virus side of reality and cavernous
615,01:08:14.460,01:08:20.860,6.39996337890625, needing a breath and a drop of water flames. Probably the most terrifying part
616,01:08:20.860,01:08:30.380,9.52001953125, of all of it is that the things there wanted you there in their clutches for
617,01:08:30.380,01:08:39.140,8.760009765625, some reason. It's a prison that collects things that no one will ever come to
618,01:08:39.140,01:08:47.660,8.52001953125, help. I'm not going to physically or personally go in to check any of that
619,01:08:47.660,01:08:55.020,7.3599853515625, out. I'm willing to take other people's word for it. Was Jesus Christ who
620,01:08:55.020,01:09:02.900,7.8800048828125, described heaven as a place full of many mansions and likened hell to this
621,01:09:02.900,01:09:11.340,8.44000244140625," actual place here, Gehenna, outside of Jerusalem where the trash was burned."
622,01:09:11.340,01:09:20.460,9.1199951171875," He was giving this analogy to common men, to sheep herders, couched in a way that"
623,01:09:20.460,01:09:28.260,7.79998779296875," they could understand it. As if the human body itself is nothing more than a shell,"
624,01:09:28.260,01:09:37.220,8.9599609375," a vessel, a confining temporal instrument binding one to a specific location in"
625,01:09:37.220,01:09:43.860,6.6400146484375," both time and space. Of those who have tried to describe heaven, though there"
626,01:09:43.860,01:09:51.820,7.96002197265625," are so many from every possible age range, background, and culture. Enoch's"
627,01:09:51.820,01:09:58.500,6.67999267578125, pre-flood account is extremely precise. People commonly talk about this unusual
628,01:09:58.500,01:10:07.020,8.52001953125, event called the rapture in the Bible. There are technically seven of them by my
629,01:10:07.020,01:10:17.420,10.39996337890625, count. Enoch is the first one on that list and he is the seventh from Adam.
630,01:10:17.420,01:10:24.060,6.6400146484375, I wonder if that has a meaning. He stumbles for words at least a dozen
631,01:10:24.060,01:10:31.620,7.55999755859375," times in his document stating to you, I wish I could describe what I'm looking"
632,01:10:31.620,01:10:40.100,8.47998046875, at. And then afterwards talking about this place as if it doesn't even feel
633,01:10:40.100,01:10:47.700,7.60003662109375," real anymore. Now to understand these things called Nephilim, or the origins of"
634,01:10:47.700,01:10:54.660,6.9599609375," physical evil, it's important to recognize the entire scope. But perhaps before taking a"
635,01:10:54.660,01:11:01.100,6.44000244140625," critical look at that pre-flood world of Genesis, or the kings with enormous"
636,01:11:01.100,01:11:08.460,7.36004638671875," lifespans before the worldwide flood in the Sumerian Kings list, or analyzing the"

638,01:11:15.260,01:11:22.540,7.27996826171875," Creatures part God, part man in this image with his arms like a crescent"
639,01:11:22.540,01:11:29.500,6.96002197265625, holding the large disk in the middle. Same as what Gilgamesh claimed he was in
640,01:11:29.500,01:11:34.860,5.3599853515625," the Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest written epic on the face of the planet"
641,01:11:34.860,01:11:42.500,7.6400146484375," Earth. The Titans, the sons of Saturn, or sons of Satan. And this isn't just Babylon"
642,01:11:42.500,01:11:50.380,7.8800048828125," or ancient Sumeria, the place of the Anunnaki, the biblical sons of Enoch."
643,01:11:50.380,01:11:58.460,8.08001708984375, Kings and rulers of ages past reaching out their hands to summons the deepest
644,01:11:58.460,01:12:05.180,6.719970703125, regions of darkness in an effort to beckon things that bite the very hand
645,01:12:05.180,01:12:13.580,8.4000244140625," that feeds into this place. The sacrifice of little children, deeply seeded,"
646,01:12:13.580,01:12:20.900,7.32000732421875," derangement, shedding of innocent blood to Moloch or Baal, working darkness into a"
647,01:12:20.900,01:12:27.660,6.760009765625," frenzy, playing the drums louder to drown out the screams. Almost like a virus"
648,01:12:27.660,01:12:35.220,7.55999755859375, reaching out to grab its own desires through an extremely naive host. To mass
649,01:12:35.220,01:12:42.780,7.55999755859375, ritualistic human sacrifice. Notice up here above that the serpent is waiting.
650,01:12:42.780,01:12:48.820,6.0400390625, It's almost as if the idea is that they're feeding something. That the
651,01:12:48.820,01:12:55.380,6.55999755859375, moment his eyes roll closed that there's something on the other side waiting for
652,01:12:55.380,01:13:02.860,7.47998046875, him to come through. Notice how the serpent is used as encapsulation. As if
653,01:13:02.860,01:13:09.980,7.1199951171875, to define ownership. It says something really fascinating in Genesis 3.15 right
654,01:13:09.980,01:13:16.300,6.32000732421875," after the eating of the fruit and the serpent in the garden. It says, I will put"
655,01:13:16.300,01:13:24.060,7.760009765625," anemone between you, the serpent, and the woman. The serpent is coming out from the"
656,01:13:24.060,01:13:31.260,7.20001220703125," forehead, the place where the third eye or the mind's eye would be placed. The eye"
657,01:13:31.260,01:13:38.940,7.67999267578125, of Horus or the all-seeing eye floating mysteriously above the pyramid of bricks
658,01:13:38.940,01:13:44.740,5.79998779296875," built by men. As a side note, it is curious how strikingly similar the eye"
659,01:13:44.740,01:13:52.900,8.15997314453125, of Horus looks in comparison to a human penile gland inside the brain and
660,01:13:52.900,01:13:59.500,6.60003662109375, dimensionally peering into this world through the glass darkly. And of course
661,01:13:59.500,01:14:06.260,6.760009765625, the Inca with the symbol of this little bitty owl sort of peering through. And
662,01:14:06.260,01:14:15.620,9.3599853515625," between your offspring, the seed of the serpent, and her offspring, he shall bruise"
663,01:14:15.620,01:14:24.460,8.8399658203125, your head and you shall bruise his heel. Now take a good look at these symbols
664,01:14:24.460,01:14:30.940,6.48004150390625, that look like little horns with a circle inside them.
665,01:14:30.940,01:14:34.620,3.680000066757202, on top of the head of these two serpents.
666,01:14:34.620,01:14:39.420,4.799999475479126, Here's an enormous version of the same symbol.
667,01:14:39.420,01:14:43.580,4.160000801086426," You're going to find quite a lot of these in ancient Egypt,"
668,01:14:43.580,01:14:48.580,4.999999046325684, perhaps quite often on the head of an Egyptian goddess.
669,01:14:48.580,01:14:50.660,2.0799999237060547, And there's the little serpent.
670,01:14:50.660,01:14:54.620,3.960000991821289, But it doesn't always have to be represented like that.
671,01:14:54.620,01:14:58.740,4.119998931884766," For example, this golden cow's head here."
672,01:14:58.740,01:15:01.220,2.479999542236328," See here, even the cow's got a little serpent"
673,01:15:01.220,01:15:06.220,5.0, with the two ears or horns that make sort of a cradle.
674,01:15:06.220,01:15:11.220,5.0, Stars always representing angels inside of it
675,01:15:11.220,01:15:16.220,5.0, with the sun shining light out from behind the ears
676,01:15:16.220,01:15:18.280,2.0600013732910156, inside of the cradle.
677,01:15:18.280,01:15:21.480,3.1999969482421875, But the sun also sort of looks like it makes
678,01:15:21.480,01:15:26.040,4.560001373291016, an eye-shaped appearance going around it
679,01:15:26.040,01:15:29.520,3.479999542236328, or a crescent moon with a star.
680,01:15:29.520,01:15:32.920,3.4000015258789062," Now, when you're talking about stars,"
681,01:15:32.920,01:15:37.920,5.0, like this large representation of a Babylonian Ishtar
682,01:15:37.920,01:15:41.220,3.3000030517578125," sitting couched inside of its crescent,"
683,01:15:41.220,01:15:44.800,3.5800018310546875," the stars, when used in ancient texts,"
684,01:15:44.800,01:15:49.800,5.0, are extremely often symbolism for angels
685,01:15:49.800,01:15:54.360,4.55999755859375, or perhaps even a very particular fallen angel.
686,01:15:54.360,01:15:59.040,4.680000305175781," The answer goes all the way back to the Temple of Hathor,"
687,01:15:59.040,01:16:02.560,3.5199966430664062, to the megacomplex of Dendera.
688,01:16:02.560,01:16:07.560,5.0, Hathor goes all the way back to King Narmer himself
689,01:16:07.560,01:16:10.160,2.5999984741210938, in Dynasty Zero.
690,01:16:10.160,01:16:14.280,4.120002746582031, That's King Narmer right there from the Narmer Pallet
691,01:16:14.280,01:16:16.840,2.55999755859375, found in the Temple of Horus.
692,01:16:16.840,01:16:21.840,5.0, Notice up here the long crown on the head of the king
693,01:16:21.840,01:16:26.840,5.0," and at the top of the pallet of the first king of Egypt,"
694,01:16:26.840,01:16:31.320,4.4799957275390625," the first symbol of the face of Hathor,"
695,01:16:31.320,01:16:35.800,4.480003356933594, a literal temple for storing the history
696,01:16:35.800,01:16:40.800,5.0, all the way back to the inception of ancient Egypt itself
697,01:16:40.800,01:16:45.800,5.0, with the symbol of Hathor crowned atop the serpent's heads.
698,01:16:45.800,01:16:50.800,5.0, The Egyptians believed that the kingship of all Egypt
699,01:16:50.800,01:16:54.960,4.160003662109375," started with one named Osiris,"
700,01:16:54.960,01:16:59.960,5.0, a dead man who would be brought back to life by Isis.
701,01:16:59.960,01:17:04.960,5.0, Osiris would be infilled and reanimated
702,01:17:04.960,01:17:09.420,4.459991455078125, by the spirit of an underworld god.
703,01:17:09.420,01:17:13.300,3.8800048828125, Notice the wings on the goddess
704,01:17:13.300,01:17:17.700,4.399993896484375," and then up over here, the little horns"
705,01:17:17.700,01:17:20.300,2.600006103515625, with the disc in the center.
706,01:17:20.300,01:17:23.540,3.2400054931640625, The flesh of the reanimated Osiris
707,01:17:23.540,01:17:27.180,3.6399993896484375, is generally a murky bluish green.
708,01:17:27.180,01:17:30.820,3.6399993896484375, This union of a resurrected dead man
709,01:17:30.820,01:17:34.700,3.8799896240234375, and a winged creature would give birth
710,01:17:34.700,01:17:38.180,3.480010986328125, to what they called Horus.
711,01:17:38.180,01:17:41.120,2.9399871826171875, Notice the disc in this image
712,01:17:41.120,01:17:45.300,4.1800079345703125, no longer is encapsulated with horns
713,01:17:45.300,01:17:50.300,5.0, but instead is simply wrapped with a serpent.
714,01:17:50.300,01:17:55.300,5.0, This shape is not two horns.
715,01:17:55.300,01:17:59.540,4.2400054931640625, It's the shape of a woman's womb
716,01:17:59.540,01:18:04.140,4.5999908447265625, which is why it's on the head of a fertility goddess
717,01:18:04.140,01:18:09.140,5.0, and the solar disc or sun disc in the center
718,01:18:09.140,01:18:14.140,5.0, is just like the star was for the Babylonians
719,01:18:14.140,01:18:19.140,5.0," and the sun in their hieroglyphs is owned by the serpent,"
720,01:18:19.140,01:18:24.140,5.0, the symbol for the ruler of the air.
721,01:18:24.140,01:18:29.140,5.0," Inside the crescent, the birth canal"
722,01:18:29.140,01:18:33.500,4.3600006103515625, or the moon being represented in the feminine
723,01:18:33.500,01:18:38.500,5.0000152587890625, in which the sun symbolically has rested inside of
724,01:18:38.500,01:18:43.500,5.0," and producing Horus, the new little eye"
725,01:18:43.500,01:18:47.980,4.480010986328125, that is peering through and watching.
726,01:18:47.980,01:18:51.060,3.079986572265625, Notice down here the serpent
727,01:18:51.060,01:18:53.460,2.399993896484375, again with the little disc on its head.
728,01:18:53.460,01:18:57.860,4.399993896484375," In fact, at the entrance to the Temple of Hathor"
729,01:18:57.860,01:19:01.600,3.740020751953125," where this enormous symbol is,"
730,01:19:01.600,01:19:06.420,4.819976806640625, there are actually 17 little bitty serpents
731,01:19:06.420,01:19:10.740,4.32000732421875, underneath that humongous symbol.
732,01:19:10.740,01:19:12.860,2.1199951171875, It's like a little identifier.
733,01:19:12.860,01:19:16.220,3.360015869140625, This plus this equals this.
734,01:19:16.220,01:19:19.180,2.959991455078125, It's like a post-it note for the ancient beast
735,01:19:19.180,01:19:21.220,2.040008544921875, popped right on top of their heads.
736,01:19:21.220,01:19:24.080,2.8599853515625," Move out of the way, we're making underworld gods here."
737,01:19:24.080,01:19:26.620,2.540008544921875," All right, they're a bunch of demons"
738,01:19:26.620,01:19:31.620,5.0," and of course, serpents in every possible"
739,01:19:31.620,01:19:34.140,2.52001953125, and spiritual sense.
740,01:19:34.140,01:19:36.780,2.639984130859375, Whatever may have been the exact details
741,01:19:36.780,01:19:41.780,5.0," of what the Egyptians were trying so dearly to express,"
742,01:19:41.780,01:19:44.940,3.160003662109375, the underworld gods are not being displayed
743,01:19:44.940,01:19:49.940,5.0, as just basic common day-to-day knowledge on their walls
744,01:19:49.940,01:19:54.940,5.0," but more than that, the focal point of the entire empire."
745,01:19:54.940,01:19:57.600,2.660003662109375, It was an oppressive place.
746,01:19:57.600,01:20:01.200,3.600006103515625, Here's a character from the walls of Egypt
747,01:20:01.200,01:20:02.960,1.760009765625, that you may recognize
748,01:20:02.960,01:20:06.880,3.91998291015625," or perhaps you're more familiar with his updated version,"
749,01:20:06.880,01:20:10.720,3.84002685546875, the star in the middle of the two horns.
750,01:20:10.720,01:20:13.640,2.91998291015625, We've even got two serpents down here coming out.
751,01:20:13.640,01:20:15.600,1.959991455078125, The Goat of Mendes.
752,01:20:15.600,01:20:20.600,5.0," This text is from the Egyptians' most treasured document,"
753,01:20:20.600,01:20:24.840,4.239990234375," the Book of the Dead, chapter 175,"
754,01:20:24.840,01:20:29.760,4.920013427734375," where Autumn would later combine with Autumn Ra,"
755,01:20:29.760,01:20:34.760,5.0," here enlisted as the high supreme god, states this."
756,01:20:34.760,01:20:39.080,4.32000732421875," Then I will be what will remain,"
757,01:20:39.080,01:20:41.240,2.160003662109375," just I and Asur,"
758,01:20:41.240,01:20:46.240,5.0, when I will have changed myself back into the old serpent
759,01:20:46.240,01:20:51.240,5.0, who knew no man and saw no god.
760,01:20:51.240,01:20:55.440,4.20001220703125," The pain, poverty, and hardship of common people"
761,01:20:55.440,01:20:58.380,2.94000244140625, does seem to follow that star.
762,01:20:58.380,01:21:03.380,5.0," Cambodia, you have the Naga serpent kings."
763,01:21:03.380,01:21:08.380,5.0," In Hindu, Vishnu sleeps in the cosmos."
764,01:21:08.380,01:21:12.340,3.959991455078125, Nirvana with the serpents.
765,01:21:12.340,01:21:15.580,3.239990234375, Perhaps King Solomon was right.
766,01:21:15.580,01:21:18.340,2.760009765625, There's nothing new under the sun.
767,01:21:18.340,01:21:21.060,2.720001220703125," Most all ancient cultures,"
768,01:21:21.060,01:21:24.980,3.920013427734375," particularly Babylon and ancient Egypt,"
769,01:21:24.980,01:21:27.540,2.55999755859375," believed that their gods,"
770,01:21:27.540,01:21:32.080,4.53997802734375," which could be physically summonsed to manifest,"
771,01:21:32.080,01:21:34.280,2.20001220703125, were in the underworld.
772,01:21:34.280,01:21:39.280,5.0, When you hear Luciferians and the cultists
773,01:21:39.280,01:21:43.280,4.0, throughout every age talking about the ability
774,01:21:43.280,01:21:47.000,3.720001220703125," to summons little spookies,"
775,01:21:47.000,01:21:50.360,3.360015869140625, things that most certainly do not have
776,01:21:50.360,01:21:52.440,2.079986572265625," your best interest at heart,"
777,01:21:52.440,01:21:56.960,4.52001953125," or entities, very tangible things,"
778,01:21:56.960,01:21:59.520,2.55999755859375," not only does it hate you,"
779,01:21:59.520,01:22:04.160,4.6400146484375, it wishes that it could be you.
780,01:22:04.160,01:22:07.720,3.55999755859375, It's my extremely strong opinion
781,01:22:07.720,01:22:12.200,4.480010986328125, that they are not making that up.
782,01:22:12.200,01:22:16.360,4.160003662109375, This was believed to be a dimension
783,01:22:16.360,01:22:21.360,5.0," running parallel, side by side with the earth,"
784,01:22:21.360,01:22:23.800,2.44000244140625," and equally as real,"
785,01:22:23.800,01:22:28.040,4.239990234375," a place full of hate, anger, bondage, terror,"
786,01:22:28.040,01:22:30.760,2.720001220703125," total lack and despair,"
787,01:22:30.760,01:22:33.640,2.8800048828125, place where mankind is herded up
788,01:22:33.640,01:22:38.640,5.0, and cast to the fangs of a vast array of frightening things.

798,01:23:10.540,01:23:14.180,3.6400146484375," Softly whispered lies,"
799,01:23:14.180,01:23:19.020,4.8399658203125," almost like the whole thing is a test,"

817,01:24:24.920,01:24:28.240,3.32000732421875, who actually built the great tower
818,01:24:28.240,01:24:31.560,3.32000732421875, that has come to be known in history
819,01:24:31.560,01:24:33.520,1.9599609375, as the Tower of Babel.
820,01:24:33.520,01:24:37.440,3.9200439453125, The name meant Gate of the God.
821,01:24:37.440,01:24:40.000,2.55999755859375, You can view the Tower of Babel
822,01:24:40.000,01:24:45.000,5.0, like one enormous mega-invocation ritual.
823,01:24:45.000,01:24:49.280,4.280029296875, They're recorded as inviting something from the darkness
824,01:24:49.280,01:24:52.000,2.719970703125, to step up from its lair.
825,01:24:52.000,01:24:55.200,3.20001220703125, Was it that point that they described something
826,01:24:55.200,01:25:00.200,5.0, sort of human-like entered?

830,01:25:13.920,01:25:18.000,4.0799560546875, as seen on this actual inscription.
831,01:25:18.000,01:25:22.240,4.239990234375, He's making entrance through this little doorway
832,01:25:22.240,01:25:25.240,3.0," with these lines around it,"
833,01:25:25.240,01:25:29.680,4.44000244140625, surrounded by these two characters
834,01:25:29.680,01:25:34.240,4.55999755859375, with heads that look something like this.
835,01:25:34.240,01:25:39.160,4.9200439453125," And the Enki was called the Lord of Earth,"

837,01:25:44.160,01:25:49.160,5.0," Sometimes the word, abzu, or the symbolism,"
838,01:25:49.160,01:25:52.120,2.9599609375," like these little wiggly lines here,"
839,01:25:52.120,01:25:55.920,3.800048828125, gets translated as waters.
840,01:25:55.920,01:25:58.320,2.39996337890625, That's not quite correct.
841,01:25:58.320,01:26:03.320,5.0," The word abzu means abyss,"
842,01:26:03.320,01:26:08.080,4.760009765625," which is where the Enki, being summonsed here,"
843,01:26:08.080,01:26:11.640,3.55999755859375, is coming forth out of.
844,01:26:11.640,01:26:15.680,4.0400390625, This stretching scape of land right here
845,01:26:15.680,01:26:19.440,3.760009765625, is believed to be the remains and ruins
846,01:26:19.440,01:26:21.160,1.719970703125," of the Tower of Babel,"
847,01:26:21.160,01:26:24.960,3.79998779296875, the place where in either the Samarian texts
848,01:26:24.960,01:26:28.080,3.1199951171875," or the biblical texts,"
849,01:26:28.080,01:26:33.080,5.0," the tongues were confused and the people began to fan out,"
850,01:26:33.080,01:26:37.520,4.44000244140625," or the ancient Ziggurat of Eridu,"
851,01:26:37.520,01:26:42.520,5.0, just 12 kilometers outside of Ur.
852,01:26:42.520,01:26:47.520,5.0," And of course, the very word Babel today means confusion."
853,01:26:47.520,01:26:52.520,5.0," If you take all of your pages and hours of history,"
854,01:26:52.520,01:26:56.640,4.1199951171875," you're dealing with a tale of two cities,"
855,01:26:56.640,01:27:01.640,5.0," Israel and Babylon, spiritual light,"
856,01:27:01.640,01:27:05.080,3.44000244140625," or conversely, spiritual darkness."
857,01:27:05.080,01:27:10.080,5.0, Everything in this place has a lower level meaning
858,01:27:10.080,01:27:12.760,2.67999267578125, and a higher level meaning.
859,01:27:12.760,01:27:15.520,2.760009765625," After the Hebrews left Egypt,"
860,01:27:15.520,01:27:20.240,4.719970703125," the land of Osiris-Ra, the Eye of Horus,"
861,01:27:20.240,01:27:24.440,4.20001220703125, and entered Sinai following the plagues of Egypt

863,01:27:27.160,01:27:30.400,3.239990234375, the Ark of the Covenant and the Mercy Seat
864,01:27:30.400,01:27:33.720,3.32000732421875," between the wings of the two archangels,"
865,01:27:33.720,01:27:37.640,3.91998291015625, placing the Ark inside the Holy of Holies
866,01:27:37.640,01:27:41.640,4.0, at the very center of the temple
867,01:27:41.640,01:27:46.200,4.55999755859375, where the high priest would go in once a year
868,01:27:46.200,01:27:50.680,4.47998046875, and he would sprinkle the blood of atonement
869,01:27:50.680,01:27:54.320,3.6400146484375, on the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant.
870,01:27:54.320,01:27:56.960,2.6400146484375," Speaking of power in the blood,"
871,01:27:56.960,01:27:59.960,3.0," I understand, Troy, Moses wrote this"
872,01:27:59.960,01:28:03.840,3.8800048828125," 2,000 years before Yeshua was born,"
873,01:28:03.840,01:28:06.160,2.32000732421875, before Jesus was born and crucified.
874,01:28:06.160,01:28:08.920,2.75994873046875, So when you say God's sacred name
875,01:28:08.920,01:28:12.000,3.08001708984375, and the high priest was sprinkling blood
876,01:28:12.000,01:28:14.000,2.0, on the Ark of the Covenant
877,01:28:14.000,01:28:17.440,3.44000244140625," and saying God's holy sacred name,"
878,01:28:17.440,01:28:20.080,2.6400146484375," sprinkling blood on the Ark,"
879,01:28:20.080,01:28:24.680,4.5999755859375," he would be saying Yahweh, Yod-Heh-Vol-Heh,"
880,01:28:24.680,01:28:29.000,4.32000732421875," and the word picture is behold the hand, behold the nail."
881,01:28:29.000,01:28:34.000,5.0," Once a year in the center of the tabernacle in the heart,"
882,01:28:34.000,01:28:39.000,5.0," that's the unspeakable name of God, by the way,"
883,01:28:39.000,01:28:40.840,1.84002685546875," in the Holy of Holies,"
884,01:28:40.840,01:28:44.080,3.239990234375," while putting the blood on the Ark of the Covenant,"
885,01:28:44.080,01:28:48.000,3.91998291015625, the high priest sprinkling the blood once a year
886,01:28:48.000,01:28:48.840,0.84002685546875, would be saying.
887,01:28:48.840,01:28:59.020,10.180000305175781," behold the hand, behold the nail. Surrounded by the encampment of all of"
888,01:28:59.020,01:29:05.880,6.8600006103515625, the Israelite tribes. God gave some very tedious instructions on the setup of
889,01:29:05.880,01:29:11.320,5.439998626708984, this camp in the wilderness with the Levite priests dead in the center. In
890,01:29:11.320,01:29:18.080,6.760000228881836, fact itemizing out what the exact population numbers were of each of the
891,01:29:18.080,01:29:24.560,6.480001449584961, tribes that were camping. Sometimes the most curious things are buried right in
892,01:29:24.560,01:29:31.680,7.119998931884766, plain sight. I saved some time for you. This is what exactly that camp would
893,01:29:31.680,01:29:39.520,7.840000152587891, have looked like. Does the shape of that precisely calculated out layout look
894,01:29:39.520,01:29:45.960,6.439998626708984, familiar? This image here is precisely what the shape of the Israelite camp
895,01:29:45.960,01:29:52.760,6.799999237060547, would have looked like. Of course the Levites and the tabernacle itself were
896,01:29:52.760,01:29:59.720,6.959999084472656," right in the center, the heart right there. And deeper inside that middle in"
897,01:29:59.720,01:30:05.280,5.560005187988281, the heart of the holiest of holies where the priest would stand before the mercy
898,01:30:05.280,01:30:14.040,8.759994506835938," seat itself and say the unspeakable name of God. Behold the hand, behold the nail."
899,01:30:14.040,01:30:23.160,9.120002746582031," This is more than 1,500 years before Jesus Christ. It was a moving cross out there"
900,01:30:23.160,01:30:28.560,5.400001525878906, on the desert floor that would have been so mesmerizing to have seen looking down
901,01:30:28.560,01:30:34.360,5.799995422363281, with all the little campfires going from the sky at night. Let's see if we can
902,01:30:34.360,01:30:42.680,8.319999694824219, take that a step deeper. Curiously if you take the names from Adam all the way
903,01:30:42.680,01:30:51.160,8.480003356933594, down to Noah in the book of Genesis and you look at the root meaning of those
904,01:30:51.160,01:31:00.560,9.400001525878906," names, this is what it reads. Man appointed mortal sorrow. The blessed God"
905,01:31:00.560,01:31:12.240,11.67999267578125, shall come down teaching. His death shall bring the despairing rest and comfort.
906,01:31:12.240,01:31:19.760,7.519989013671875, You'd have a terrible time convincing me that some Hebrew scribes concocted that
907,01:31:19.760,01:31:26.520,6.760009765625, in the Genesis text. Nonetheless let's go deeper than that. Pre-flood book of Enoch.
908,01:31:26.520,01:31:33.680,7.1599884033203125, He goes further than just fallen angels and hybrid offspring. Enoch is
909,01:31:33.680,01:31:40.480,6.8000030517578125," redundantly prophesying the coming of this Son of Man, laying out that at a"
910,01:31:40.480,01:31:48.240,7.760009765625," time in the future not only will what has been done be undone, but further that"
911,01:31:48.240,01:31:57.640,9.399993896484375, through his name they shall be saved. There are at least 365 extremely
912,01:31:57.640,01:32:05.920,8.279998779296875, specific prophecies of the coming of that child and the sacrifice of a Savior.
913,01:32:05.920,01:32:12.480,6.55999755859375, The Passover began before the final plague in Egypt before the Israelite
914,01:32:12.480,01:32:22.000,9.520004272460938," slaves marched out of the largest empire on earth, fulfilling every single rule of"
915,01:32:22.000,01:32:30.440,8.44000244140625, a Passover sacrifice no less. And before the final plague of Egypt they were to
916,01:32:30.440,01:32:38.120,7.67999267578125, put the blood of the Passover lamb on their doorpost. Curious what meanings
917,01:32:38.120,01:32:43.160,5.0399932861328125," can be found in things when you're willing to scratch. One curious detail,"
918,01:32:43.160,01:32:48.840,5.6800079345703125, the symbol of the Tav during any Canaanite or pre-Canaanite time period
919,01:32:48.840,01:32:58.340,9.5," would have looked something like this. It is true that the ancient Tav, meaning"
920,01:32:58.340,01:33:07.780,9.439987182617188," sign or mark, perhaps covenant, looks something exactly like this. Crucifixion"
921,01:33:07.780,01:33:15.540,7.760009765625, would not even become a practice until five ages of empires later under the
922,01:33:15.540,01:33:23.700,8.160003662109375," Romans. It is interesting that the blood would be saving their firstborn sons,"
923,01:33:23.700,01:33:32.260,8.55999755859375," while God would be giving up his. In fact, even done on Passover day while the"
924,01:33:32.260,01:33:41.340,9.079986572265625," kings of earth were throwing babies onto open fire pits and flames, sparing no"
925,01:33:41.340,01:33:49.220,7.8800048828125, expense to build the grandest of towers and ziggurats to feed darkness their
926,01:33:49.220,01:33:56.180,6.96002197265625, subjects lives. To satisfy and appease the unending thirst of their little bitty
927,01:33:56.180,01:34:04.580,8.399993896484375, otherworldly underworld gods. Something tells me that in a minute here the
928,01:34:04.580,01:34:11.980,7.399993896484375, underworld gods and the shadow people are gonna have a role to play in all
929,01:34:11.980,01:34:21.460,9.480010986328125, this before we get to the end. What greater love could one have than to lay
930,01:34:21.460,01:34:30.140,8.67999267578125, down their life for their friends. Here's the empty tomb where Jesus was for three
931,01:34:30.140,01:34:40.020,9.8800048828125, days. That 365 specific prophecies about Jesus Christ by no means includes the
932,01:34:40.020,01:34:45.820,5.79998779296875, fabric of patterns. There are at least four times that many for the second
933,01:34:45.820,01:34:53.900,8.08001708984375, coming. The hours when all the old scorecards get tallied up than there are
934,01:34:53.900,01:35:01.860,7.959991455078125, for the first. Restoration and the entrance and return of the king. But out
935,01:35:01.860,01:35:07.860,6.0, of all of those prophecies there's only one other person other than Enoch who
936,01:35:07.860,01:35:15.140,7.279998779296875, used this term son of man. That would have been Daniel who survived the lion's
937,01:35:15.140,01:35:22.540,7.399993896484375, den. Well in the very heart of Babylon no less. It's astounding how these things
938,01:35:22.540,01:35:28.860,6.32000732421875, work out. Was Daniel who interpreted the king of Babylon Nebuchadnezzar's dream of
939,01:35:28.860,01:35:36.540,7.67999267578125, the five empires leading to the end including Nebuchadnezzar's own and not
940,01:35:36.540,01:35:42.500,5.959991455078125, including the two before it. That makes a total of seven. I wonder if that means
941,01:35:42.500,01:35:49.260,6.760009765625, anything. But an angel would appear in the later years of Daniel's life. More
942,01:35:49.260,01:35:55.780,6.519989013671875, specifically Gabriel the same angel that came to Mary prior to the birth of Jesus
943,01:35:55.780,01:36:03.140,7.360015869140625, Christ as well as believed to be an angel at the tomb after the resurrection.
944,01:36:03.140,01:36:10.420,7.279998779296875, And not only give him a tit-for-tat sentence by sentence line for line
945,01:36:10.420,01:36:16.180,5.760009765625, walkthrough of coming history and we know that none of that precision was
946,01:36:16.180,01:36:22.820,6.639984130859375, done after the fact because the Septuagint which included Daniel was put
947,01:36:22.820,01:36:31.300,8.480010986328125, together under Ptolemy during the third century BC as is seen in Daniel 11
948,01:36:31.300,01:36:36.820,5.519989013671875, beginning with the kings of the north and the kings of the south the Seleucid
949,01:36:36.820,01:36:42.500,5.680023193359375, and Ptolemaic empires predicting even the unlikely rise of the little-known
950,01:36:42.500,01:36:48.980,6.47998046875, underdog which would later come to be known as the Empire of Rome. Those are
951,01:36:48.980,01:36:56.060,7.08001708984375, some really impressive guesses but by far the most impressive of the entire
952,01:36:56.060,01:37:04.580,8.519989013671875, bunch is that Daniel would predict the exact day and date that Jesus Christ
953,01:37:04.580,01:37:12.820,8.239990234375, would enter the front gate of Jerusalem on the back of a donkey fulfilling
954,01:37:12.820,01:37:19.500,6.680023193359375, Zechariah 9 9 that the people rejoice as the King cometh on the back of a foul
955,01:37:19.500,01:37:29.700,10.20001220703125, donkey. This would be the 10th of Nisan or more precisely April 6th 32 AD four
956,01:37:29.700,01:37:36.180,6.47998046875, days before the crucifixion. Daniel is giving you the exact starting point.
957,01:37:36.180,01:37:45.700,9.52001953125, Daniel 9 25 states know and understand this from the time that the word goes
958,01:37:45.700,01:37:58.140,12.44000244140625, out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed one the King comes
959,01:37:58.140,01:38:07.620,9.47998046875, the date that a Persian king gave the decree of Artaxerxes on March 14th 445
960,01:38:07.620,01:38:16.620,9.0, BC to restore and rebuild Jerusalem after the Persians had defeated Babylon
961,01:38:16.620,01:38:25.380,8.760009765625, in exactly the way by exactly the guy Cyrus that Isaiah had predicted 200
962,01:38:25.380,01:38:35.260,9.8800048828125, years in advance. Countdown leading to the precise day and writing this more
963,01:38:35.260,01:38:43.060,7.79998779296875, than 500 years in advance. It brings new meaning to when Jesus Christ told the
964,01:38:43.060,01:38:50.340,7.27996826171875, Pharisees you think that in those scriptures you have eternal life but
965,01:38:50.340,01:38:59.260,8.9200439453125, it's those very pages that speak of me. Because of the mass reports of healings
966,01:38:59.260,01:39:06.500,7.239990234375, and blind eyes open on many occasions the masses had wanted to make him king
967,01:39:06.500,01:39:14.380,7.8800048828125, but he never allowed them to praise him and declare him out as king until one
968,01:39:14.380,01:39:21.060,6.67999267578125, very particular day that Daniel had given the math for more than 500 years
969,01:39:21.060,01:39:27.500,6.44000244140625, in advance. Arriving at the front gate of Jerusalem the religious leaders the
970,01:39:27.500,01:39:34.940,7.44000244140625, Pharisees told Jesus you have to shut these people up this is heresy. Jesus
971,01:39:34.940,01:39:43.260,8.32000732421875, replied to the Pharisees if I were to silence these people indeed I tell you
972,01:39:43.260,01:39:51.060,7.79998779296875, even the rocks of this place would cry out. If you do the math from the decree
973,01:39:51.060,01:40:00.300,9.239990234375, of Artaxerxes to the triumphant entry this point here 69 times 7 times 360
974,01:40:00.300,01:40:06.140,5.84002685546875, using the identical calendar system of the ancient world most especially
975,01:40:06.140,01:40:12.140,6.0, Babylon making provision for the 24 day difference between March 14th and April
976,01:40:12.140,01:40:17.380,5.239990234375, 6th as well as your hundred and sixteen days added in for leap years you're
977,01:40:17.380,01:40:25.660,8.27996826171875," gonna come up to exactly 173,880 days. On the money Daniel's"
978,01:40:25.660,01:40:33.900,8.24005126953125, margin of error more than 500 years beforehand from that angel's lips was
979,01:40:33.900,01:40:42.900,9.0, precisely zero. But if I hop backwards much before Daniel before even the young
980,01:40:42.900,01:40:50.340,7.44000244140625, David stamped into the pages of history for the highly unusual miraculous
981,01:40:50.340,01:40:59.580,9.239990234375, defeat of a six-fingered giant named Goliath. But going back past even David
982,01:40:59.580,01:41:06.580,7.0, the one often called a man after God's own heart beyond the days in the
983,01:41:06.580,01:41:13.940,7.3599853515625, wilderness then even the time in Egypt back to our first little starting gate
984,01:41:13.940,01:41:23.300,9.3599853515625, cultures down here in Egypt and over here in Samaria the place of ancient
985,01:41:23.300,01:41:30.740,7.44000244140625, Uruk to where Gilgamesh depicted here his statue ruled right here to the land
986,01:41:30.740,01:41:40.420,9.6800537109375, an area of Ur. Now that is a giant holding a lion right? Where Abraham the
987,01:41:40.420,01:41:47.740,7.3199462890625, father of all the future children of Israel was living. Many believe that
988,01:41:47.740,01:41:54.660,6.9200439453125, Abraham could see the base of the Tower of Babel while growing up. And then it
989,01:41:54.660,01:42:03.660,9.0, begins a little something like this. Get thee out of thy country and from thy
990,01:42:03.660,01:42:14.060,10.39996337890625, kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show unto thee.
991,01:42:14.060,01:42:22.100,8.0400390625, Abraham would ultimately travel over here to exactly where modern-day
992,01:42:22.100,01:42:30.100,8.0, Jerusalem is. And I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and
993,01:42:30.100,01:42:37.220,7.1199951171875, make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that
994,01:42:37.220,01:42:47.100,9.8800048828125, bless thee and curse them that curseth thee. That's a very big promise. One night
995,01:42:47.100,01:42:54.900,7.79998779296875, he woke up with hot sweats and horrors that the Lord had shown him that his
996,01:42:54.900,01:43:04.540,9.63995361328125, descendants would be slaves in a foreign land for 400 years but that God himself
997,01:43:04.540,01:43:16.900,12.36004638671875, said that he would judge that nation. And in thee shall all the families of the
998,01:43:16.900,01:43:29.140,12.239990234375, earth be blessed. Genesis 12 1 through 3. What those pages are telling you is that
999,01:43:29.140,01:43:40.420,11.27996826171875," the Hebrews, Israel, was the delivery system for the Savior of all mankind."
1000,01:43:40.420,01:43:45.900,5.47998046875, Leading full circle to the most well-known passage in the whole
1001,01:43:45.900,01:43:48.940,3.0400390625, masquerade
1002,01:43:48.940,01:43:57.560,8.619999885559082, of particles that makes up the planet earth. For God so loved the world that he
1003,01:43:57.560,01:44:10.300,12.74000072479248, gave his one and only Son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but
1004,01:44:10.300,01:44:19.780,9.479999542236328, have everlasting and eternal life. And every single possible thing short of the
1005,01:44:19.780,01:44:26.740,6.959999084472656," kitchen sink tried to stand in the way of that. What those pages are saying, all"
1006,01:44:26.740,01:44:33.340,6.600002288818359," of them, is that you, no matter who you are on the other side of the screen, were"
1007,01:44:33.340,01:44:41.860,8.519996643066406, born above even the angels. Someone asked me the other day how I truly thought
1008,01:44:41.860,01:44:50.220,8.360000610351562, that the entire universe was held together. I was stumped by the question.
1009,01:44:50.220,01:45:01.580,11.360000610351562, Here's my answer. It's love. Totally undeserved love. Never listen to snakes
1010,01:45:01.580,01:45:13.220,11.639999389648438, because they're snakes. You were born to be free in every possible sense in both
1011,01:45:13.220,01:45:22.100,8.8800048828125, this life and the next. It's my extremely strong opinion that the shadow people
1012,01:45:22.100,01:45:29.780,7.67999267578125, are not your friends. Go on your own journey to ask these very same questions.
1013,01:45:29.780,01:45:38.980,9.200004577636719," Your life is worth that. Oh, before I forget, Jesus did say another thing to"
1014,01:45:38.980,01:45:49.660,10.680000305175781," his disciples. In Matthew 24 it says, So it was in the days of Noah, so also shall"
1015,01:45:49.660,01:45:59.940,10.279991149902344, it be in the day of the return of the Son of Man. One can only wonder what
1016,01:45:59.940,01:46:08.620,8.680007934570312, exactly that might mean. It is true that the grand finale of any fireworks show
1017,01:46:08.620,01:46:17.940,9.319992065429688, is always at the end. I'm Trey Smith and I hope you enjoyed the video. Here's some
1018,01:46:17.940,01:46:26.660,8.720001220703125, fireworks for you of the friendly kind. Look at how that skull actually does
1019,01:46:26.660,01:46:36.540,9.8800048828125, have an enormous skull cap on the back. That it is genetically different in its
1020,01:46:36.540,01:46:45.620,9.080001831054688," bone structure than a human skull. It's not just that the head is longer, it's"
1021,01:46:45.620,01:46:52.260,6.6399993896484375," actually got a different structure. Coming this winter, soon or maybe even"
