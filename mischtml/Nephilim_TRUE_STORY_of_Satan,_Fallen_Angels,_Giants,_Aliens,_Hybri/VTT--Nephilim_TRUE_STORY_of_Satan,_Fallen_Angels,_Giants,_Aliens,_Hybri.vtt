00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
 The skulls and artifacts in this video are authentic from sites all around the globe.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.039
 Feel free to share, but please do not download and respect the copyrights herein.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.399
 Viewer discretion advised.

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:23.479
 So tell me straight, Rabbi, have any powerful people attempted to bury this knowledge?

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:27.620
 I tried to figure out what was the disconnect in history.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:36.500
 This video is about the Nephilim, a mystery that goes back even further than Babylon.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.060
 Enjoy the ride.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:47.299
 Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterwards when the sons of God went

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:53.700
 in to the daughters of men and bore children by them.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 These were the mighty ones of old, famous warriors of ancient times.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.699
 If all the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd century, and then even the early Jewish commentators all

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:11.699
 stood on the same ground with this, why is there such a disconnect?

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:13.699
 I researched something interesting.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:19.699
 There was a second council in Constantinople from the early Roman church.

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:23.699
 This was in 553 A.D.

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:28.699
 They decreed that the teachings of Origen, an early church writer on the subject of angels,

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:30.699
 could be hearsay.

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:34.699
 This guy here was found in Peru.

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:38.699
 And here's a little baby one from Peru.

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:40.699
 Take a look at that right there.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:46.699
 Look at the little fingers on that going up that long head.

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:50.699
 This of course is Siberia, Russia.

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:54.699
 Look at the size of the mallet on that one from Peru.

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:58.699
 He almost doesn't look friendly, does he?

00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:02.699
 And this one here is from the sands of Iran.

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:09.699
 This is one of apparently about 20 from a dig site in Germany.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:19.699
 Would you say there's anything at all about that guy there that doesn't look, I don't know, human?

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.699
 This one was found in Bolivia.

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:24.699
 Hold on to your seats.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:31.699
 We're going to go over some unique features on these long heads in just a minute.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 Also found in Russia, Peru.

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 The sheer mass on the back of some of these is astounding.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.699
 Here's a child being held.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.699
 Look at the size of that one in the middle.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:52.699
 This may be the largest one in terms of head volume out of Peru.

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:57.699
 Now we're really starting to leave the it looks human range.

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:06.699
 This guy here was one of 13 found at a dig site in Mexico.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.699
 It's a biblical Hebrew text.

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.699
 And you start finding a lot of strange anomalies.

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.699
 You know, you read about giants.

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:23.699
 When Moshe Moses sent the spies over into Cana, and they described this land being filled full of giants.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:30.699
 You know, when the spies come back, they said, you know, what were the size of grasshoppers compared to these men?

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:35.699
 The word Nephilim often gets translated as giants.

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.699
 It is true there have been actual giants in history.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.699
 This is Robert Wadlow.

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:50.699
 He's the tallest man ever officially recorded in this modern time period at 8 feet 11 inches.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:57.700
 This photograph was taken by Roy Chapman Andrews during an expedition to Mongolia in 1922.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.700
 The image ran one time in National Geographic magazine.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.700
 It was never published in the magazine again.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.700
 Signals describing a guy with six fingers and toes.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.700
 And he's not calling it a deformity.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.700
 Now, you know, I've seen people who've had a toe, but it's a deformity.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.700
 These are six working fingers and toes.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.700
 I actually found an ancient picture from Babylon of a giant with six fingers and toes.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.700
 And the giant is actually holding a lion.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.700
 And he is so large that the lion is held like I would hold a cat.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:45.700
 Like I'm saying to you, only if you're reading in the Hebrew are you going to see how deep this goes and how actually clear it is.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.700
 It is curious where the trail can begin to lead when looking at ancient bloodlines.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:01.700
 When talking about the word Nephilim, what we're dealing with is a little bit deeper and darker and larger in scope

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.700
 than giantism, a really tall guy, or your favorite basketball player.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.700
 The term Nephilim became synonymous with giants because that's what they tended to be.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.700
 It is by no means limited to that meaning.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:27.700
 In fact, the word Nephilim is more of an umbrella term for the hybrid children, creatures of any high strangeness,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:37.700
 which are actual flesh and blood, biological products of the Beneha Elohim, the fallen angels.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:45.700
 Well, first, the word Nephilim is actually a plural from the Hebrew word Nephal, fallen.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.700
 And when you say Nephilim, you're basically saying the fallen ones.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.700
 Genesis chapter 6 verses 1 through 2 says that when men began to increase,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.700
 the number of the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:11.700
 The term sons of God or the Beneha Elohim can mean angels, fallen angels, or in the book of Enoch, the watchers.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:21.700
 Sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they married any of them that they chose and had children by them.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:31.700
 So at this moment, without going off of any of the physical evidence and before taking a really deep look at these skulls

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:39.700
 or peering into the history and just using the texts alone, in any authentic text,

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.700
 whether you're dealing with actual angels or you're talking about fallen angels,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.700
 these are not Hallmark card creatures. These are extremely powerful entities.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.700
 Angels often get depicted in artwork with wings.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:05.700
 Now the Ark of the Covenant does have two cherubim depicted with wings over the mercy seat.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:14.700
 But, key term here, these angels are representing the cherubim at the throne of God in heaven.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:22.700
 But I can't find one spot in the entirety of the Greek or Hebrew biblical texts

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:34.700
 where angels, dimensional beings, Beneha Elohim, stepping through into this reality had wings.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.700
 From the angels at the tomb of Jesus Christ, no wings.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.700
 All the way back to Genesis, to the angels that visited Abraham,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.700
 to the angel that dropped the chains from Peter's wrists and said,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.700
 Get up and come with me.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:03.700
 Every iron locked door opening before their path and soldiers seeming to fall by the wayside, unconscious.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.700
 Peter had some clout with someone somewhere that night.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:17.700
 The soldiers that had fallen asleep woke up to be executed the very next day.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.700
 The truth is there are wealths of these throughout the text.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:29.700
 The helping hand that seems to arrive in extremely particular moments

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.700
 when all hope might otherwise seem lost.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:41.700
 Or messengers appearing to announce highly specific events in human history.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.700
 Events and moments that would change everything.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:55.700
 You know, it almost reads like someone sort of guided how all this comes out.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:04.700
 One of the most stunning discoveries of the 20th century is that the entirety of the universe is finite.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.700
 That's actually extremely powerful knowledge.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:17.700
 Reality can appear solid, but in truth, it's 99.9% empty space.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:27.700
 The base framework of reality itself at the deepest quantum level is not made of matter,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:36.700
 but of little statistical probabilities appearing wherever they need to appear next.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:49.700
 Even the majestic ticking minutes of time itself are quantized at 10 to the negative 43 seconds.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:10:00.700
 And every single three-dimensional particle pixel of this place is not random.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.700
 In fact, they're 10 to the negative 33 centimeters.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.700
 The fabric of reality is finite.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.700
 Almost like a pure data live stream.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.700
 And it's not random.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.700
 That's extremely powerful knowledge.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.700
 It was Albert Einstein who once said,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.700
 reality is merely an illusion.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:30.700
 When you hear the physics guys talking about the universe as a hologram,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:39.700
 or saying that our reality is a simplified projection of a much more complex reality,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.700
 or saying that time, space, and matter are synthetic,

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.700
 I don't know if I like the term projection. It seems far too limiting.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:11:00.700
 Or mathematicians who might say that the whole place appears to be a product of mathematics,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:06.700
 which our mathematics are extremely inadequate to describe.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:16.700
 It is true that a created thing can never understand the full scope of who created it.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:28.700
 The bottom line that this place is couched in a much larger spiritual and dimensional reality.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.700
 These are the words of Paul when writing to the Hebrews.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:41.700
 Do not forget to entertain strangers, for some have entertained angels unaware.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:49.700
 How can a spiritual being, an angel, or even a whole set of fallen angels,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.700
 give actual birth to its own genetic line of anomalies?

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:04.700
 How can something spiritual, dimensional, interact with something physical?

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.700
 I'm not sure that the lines are quite that black and white.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.700
 It was Jude, the half-brother of Jesus Christ.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.700
 Mind you, this comes right before Jude quotes from Enoch 1.9.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:29.700
 Enoch would be the seventh from Adam, the great-grandfather of Noah in the book of Genesis.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:37.700
 Genesis 5.24, and Enoch was not, for God took him.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.700
 God really liked Enoch.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:48.700
 And so Jude is saying, even the angels, which kept not their first estate.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.700
 Angels there is talking about fallen angels.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:58.700
 The term kept not their first estate has a dual meaning in that sentence.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:07.700
 Not just that they left the heavens, but their physical bodies for earthly flesh and material bodies.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:17.700
 Jude continues, but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.700
 under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.700
 These are actual fragments from the book of Enoch,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:37.700
 found in the caves of Qumran in Israel, dating anywhere between 100 to 400 BC.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:43.700
 And of course the most famous document and record to come out of those caves

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:51.700
 was this actual image of a scroll of Isaiah found in those caves,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.700
 which had scholars literally holding their breath

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:01.700
 until they found out that every single word has an exact precision

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.700
 matching our current text that is uncanny.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:13.700
 This applies to all of the Hebrew texts, by the way, even the Greek Jewish texts.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:20.700
 The fragments from the book of Enoch matched up perfectly with copies found

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:28.700
 by explorer James Bruce in Complete Ethiopian Bibles in 1773.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:34.700
 The book of Enoch is divided into five sections.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.700
 It's in the Book of the Watchers, where the book...

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:47.220
 of the Qumran fragments come from, then Enoch is telling you that a set of 200 fallen angels

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.580
 made physical entrance to this place.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:59.300
 This would have been prior to the flood of Noah, as Enoch was the great-grandfather of

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.300
 Noah.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.900
 In fact, this would have been more than a thousand years before Noah, as Methuselah,

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:13.900
 the longest living man ever recorded in the biblical text, lived 969 years.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:23.420
 If you do the math on it, Methuselah actually died the very year, or seven days, before

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.420
 the flood.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:34.500
 Curiously, the name Methuselah means, his death shall bring, or perhaps more precisely,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.260
 his death shall bring the judgment.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:46.560
 Speaking of strange skulls, skulls like this one here are what the archeological community

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:56.060
 often refer to as Neanderthal skulls, like this actual image of a Neanderthal skull

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.660
 on the screen here.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:05.420
 Now there are all sorts of variations, shapes, and sizes of monkey bones on the planet earth.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:13.180
 Monkeys and humans are grandly different in their bone structures.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:21.980
 This is a human skeleton, and this is a set of monkey bones, like this actual bone structure

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.900
 of a gorilla on the screen right here.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.300
 Out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of both human

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:39.740
 bones and monkey bones, such as the infamous skeletal structure of the small monkey Lucy,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:48.420
 seen on the screen here, on the entire face of the whole planet earth, there are exactly

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:57.340
 zero mixtures of half human, half monkey, or monkeys becoming humans.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.500
 Or the more commonly used terminology, there are no missing links.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.340
 This doesn't come as terribly surprising to me, because genetically speaking, within the

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:16.720
 DNA of any living, breathing organism, animals are restricted within their animal kinds.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.720
 They have certain body plans.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:27.540
 For example, horses can breed other variations of horses within their body plans.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.080
 Same thing with dogs.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:37.640
 They can have subtypes underneath that body plan and variations, but dogs cannot breed

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.160
 rabbits or horses.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:48.960
 Taking the genetics one step further, every living organism, its digital software coding,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:55.660
 its actual DNA, is losing coding over time.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.760
 It's weakening, deteriorating.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:08.280
 It's not just animal species that we are systematically and slowly losing, not gaining, in the order

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.400
 of a thousand to ten thousand different creatures annually, depending on whose numbers that

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:21.040
 you listen to, but we're certainly losing things as opposed to gaining them.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:29.040
 And following suit with that, the DNA, the actual digital software of life itself, for

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:36.460
 every type of creature, is also weakening with every generation.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:43.540
 The same as would happen as if you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:50.420
 of anything, you're going to see it weaken, not strengthen.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:59.180
 A Neanderthal skeleton and skull is absolutely identical to a modern human, except for a

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.300
 few key features.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.400
 The bones are thicker, stronger, more fit.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.800
 Also the wisdom teeth down here fit absolutely perfectly.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.200
 These thick brows can vary in size from skull to skull.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:23.000
 A small detail that a lot of people may not know, the human brow of any individual, this

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.480
 bone right up here, continues to grow just ever so slightly through the entirety of a

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.480
 person's life.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:37.880
 You may see on an old man's brow, he's got a very defined brow.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:45.040
 So if you were to live two or three or four or five hundred years, then that much larger

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:55.400
 brow that you see indenting up right there is precisely how your skull would look.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:03.600
 When we peer back in history to our oldest written texts, we're finding redundant accounts

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.080
 of very long lifespans.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:13.200
 In the biblical texts, most absolutely and definitely in the Sumerian kings list, as

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:21.240
 well as records covering what amounts to little more than settlements following the great

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:30.560
 flood as is recorded here in the Epic of Gilgamesh, along with the extended lifespans,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.320
 both before and briefly after the flood.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.280
 This is the oldest written epic in the entire world.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:51.520
 The actual records of King Gilgamesh of Uruk, one of the first kings following the great

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.840
 flood.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.900
 These Neanderthal skulls have varying sizes of large brows.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:07.520
 In short, what you're looking at with these Neanderthal skulls is eerily identical to

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:18.120
 what a human being would look like if they were much more fit than we are today and had

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:24.020
 lived varying amounts of hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:32.200
 From a genetic perspective, no one actually knows what causes death or initiates the death

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:40.160
 process, capping us out in anywhere between 100 and 120 years.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.720
 Almost as if someone flicked a switch off inside the coding.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:53.360
 Every single cell in your entire body is programmed to regenerate and renew itself.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:05.080
 But when dealing with the topic of the Nephilim, we are by no means talking about elongated

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:13.840
 years and larger brows, stronger bodies and wisdom teeth that fit perfect like a glove.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.240
 The extremely long years resting on the large brow of the forehead.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:25.640
 Nor are we fiddling around with old monkey bones.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:32.360
 The truth, however, is that there are a lot of human-esque bones on this planet which

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:41.160
 can very easily, even to trained experts, blur the lines between was it human or was

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.880
 it something else.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.280
 Now there are a lot of tribes that have done varieties of things to their bodies to achieve

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.920
 a number of different effects including the binding of the skull to produce this elongated

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.700
 shape on the back of the head.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:05.360
 There are some significant differences, however, between even the best of clearly modified

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:13.000
 skulls like this skull on the screen here and skulls that appear significantly larger

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 and much more naturally formed than that, like this actual elongated skull being compared

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.080
 against the bust of either Nefertiti or Akhenaten's daughter.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:37.320
 Leading many to ask if these tribesmen originally began binding babies' heads in an attempt

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:46.400
 to copy something that was perhaps a whole lot larger in scope, like this actual skull

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.600
 found in Peru.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.240
 Some of these are just absolutely massive and there are hundreds and hundreds of them,

00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:00.040
 wildly massive, including children that already have the features.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.920
 One of the first red flags that you're dealing with something that is incredibly strange

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:19.520
 is that the actual head volume of the elongated skull is at least 25% larger in its head volume

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.119
 than a regular human or even an old human skull.

00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:27.040
 These are in fact quite different.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:34.360
 But it's not just that they absolutely have to be enormously massive, there's another

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:42.360
 difference on just the skulls themselves which is even more puzzling than that.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:51.920
 Every human skull on every single human being should have these two plates in the back of

00:24:51.920 --> 00:25:00.040
 the skull that are clearly divided between the two of them by this crease running towards

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.800
 the back of the head.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:09.119
 This elongated skull, however, is not like that with the crease and the two plates in

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:10.600
 the back.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:19.420
 This skull has one long crease, very defined here, a crease coming back this way, and one

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.000
 very large skull cap.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.960
 Binding a little baby's head should most certainly not change the genetic bone structure.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.160
 But it's not just elongated heads we're talking about.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:43.440
 We're also talking about giants like this Thailand image holding the enormous sword

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.760
 and the two fangs or tusks coming out of the mouth.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.760
 Now I do believe that's a Babylonian Ishtar right there depicted as a circular disk which

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:03.760
 these three gentlemen are bringing before this very large character.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:14.880
 Babylon, particularly ancient Babylon, plays perhaps a critical role in all this.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.320
 Just second down from Babylon would be Egypt.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.560
 After the Hebrews were in the wilderness during the time of the tabernacle and about

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:33.560
 to enter the promised land, in Numbers 13.33 it says this,

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:44.280
 And there we saw the giants, the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who were of the giants,

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.760
 and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers before them.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:57.560
 Now there are some tribes where God told the Hebrews, just conquer the people.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:04.360
 And then there are other tribes where God specified, wipe them all out.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.800
 As if there's some type of a gene pool problem.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:15.480
 As is in the case of the Canaanites, the Raphites, the Ammonites, all of which are listed as

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 giants.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.840
 And then you've got other types of tribes, like for example, the Amalekites.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.280
 The first part of Amalekite means people.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:36.440
 The second part of Amalekite, it's an ancient word in Semitic languages that means vampire-like

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 demon.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:44.880
 These Amalekites were not human, and a lot of people believe that this is where the vampire

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.680
 legends came from in Romania.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.680
 And I'm sure the Israelites well knew this by looking at them.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:28:00.080
 I mean, if the Amalekites are considered a vampire-like demon, you know, I'm sure they

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.920
 probably had the features.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:13.280
 Deuteronomy 3.11, Only King Og of Bashan the giant was left remaining of the Raphites,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.080
 the Ammonites, or so the Hebrews believed.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:26.920
 But the truth is, giants have been reported in archaeological finds all across the globe,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:36.080
 particularly in the United States, which is what most every one of these news articles

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.560
 right here going down the screen are about.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.440
 Many of them from the New York Times.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:53.240
 Some bones are still available, however, like this actual image of a jawbone recovered from

00:28:53.240 --> 00:29:03.440
 a giant skeleton in Nevada that's being compared to a human jawbone on the screen.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.380
 How large do you think that skeleton actually was?

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:13.100
 Or the Indian legend of the red-headed giants.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:19.820
 Interesting about Indian legends, the symbol of the how is often said to ensure that the

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.580
 other guy does not have six fingers.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:33.980
 Or the famous serpent mounds in Ohio, where in the 1800s it's reported that skeletons

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.100
 of enormous giants

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:45.960
 were found around this site that has the shape of an enormous serpent that they mysteriously

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:51.300
 built, which can only truly be seen well from the air.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:59.520
 Following the 1950s and the defeat of Nazi Germany and eugenics, same time period that

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:08.440
 Americans begin pumping out movies about space invaders and men coming from other planets

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:15.760
 and deeply religious views of the occult, such as those of Blavatsky, instrumental in

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:24.120
 the occult beliefs of Adolf Hitler himself, sort of take a sidestep into the shadows,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:35.440
 particles such as these begin to dry up and disappear in roughly about the 1950s, and

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.200
 the skeletons seem to vanish.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:49.280
 Many make the strong case that the bone structures disagree with the political formulation of

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.440
 the theory of evolution.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:59.200
 Whereas that may be true, there are others who would argue that it's somewhat deeper

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200
 than that.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:08.200
 Speaking of occult, if I shift my attention over in the direction of ancient Egypt, the

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:16.160
 place that occasionally had kings with very unusual skulls, like this actual imagery

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:24.440
 here done using the skull of King Akhenaten.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:33.360
 Here's the skull of the 18th Dynasty King Akhenaten without any digital effects on it.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:43.160
 This piece of artwork is female, believed by many to be Akhenaten's daughter.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:54.680
 Here is his son, the child king, in this x-ray on the screen here, the very infamous

00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:04.400
 King Tut, who also had this rather, this family had very unique features, long head, in all

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:10.880
 of the drawings of himself, like this actual drawing of Akhenaten.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:19.360
 Notice the crown is very elongated, and the strange shape of the body.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.760
 And this is the wife, Nefertiti, carved in stone.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:31.640
 This king moved the most powerful palace in all of Egypt to rule over an area called Amarna

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:38.800
 to take the pentacle of power and throne of the empire from Thebes and Abydos and the

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:48.440
 land of the old gods, all the way up here to a newly prospering place called Amarna,

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:54.560
 which is directly across the Red Sea from Sinai.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:05.080
 Curious thing about the ruins of this particular dig site, it has a reported 365 outdoor altars,

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:13.520
 the practice of worship of one god, a mesmerizing place stretching into the horizon, and it's

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:21.600
 an entirely well-drawn community, all three of which are not Egyptian practices, they're

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.840
 Hebrew practices.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:33.520
 One thing that Akhenaten and his son, King Tut, both proved is that even god kings can

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.800
 die.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:40.840
 Both were killed with remarkably similar bashes in their long heads.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:48.720
 I personally think that the visor eye did it in cahoots with the head military general,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:59.520
 Ramses, great-grandfather of Ramses the Great, but I wasn't there and the statute of limitations

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.760
 has run out.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:10.400
 Akhenaten, shown here with the serpent coming out of his forehead, and his son, Tut, were

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:20.560
 the final kings of the 18th dynasty, later giving rise to the 19th dynasty king, Ramses

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:29.000
 the Great, immortalized in this statue here, who many believe was the pharaoh at the time

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.680
 of the exodus.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:41.280
 Mernpetah, depicted here standing next to Ra with the disc encapsulated by the serpent,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:49.600
 Mernpetah was the next king to take the throne of Egypt after Ramses.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.280
 He was also the 13th son of Ramses the Great.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:02.240
 Akhenaten, on his victory steel, depicted right here, makes a strange statement.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.880
 The people of Israel is laid waste.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.640
 Their crops are not.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.240
 I have no idea what that means.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:19.880
 Just because your dad, Ramses, hands you an empire, missing at least half of its army

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:26.120
 and all of its slaves, you can't go getting all bent out of shape about that.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:34.420
 But if I am to hop way backwards in time, that 200 fallen angels recorded as having

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:40.940
 come in prior to the flood, which is really what's being referred to when you hear terms

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.080
 like mystery religion.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:50.160
 Here's the star inside of the golden jewel-covered present.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.320
 Covered in the book of Enoch, alluded to in the book of Genesis, as well as many parts

00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:03.600
 of both the Old and New Testament, as well as ancient texts and hieroglyphs that we'll

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:09.000
 look at, and writings all across the ancient world.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:18.040
 Being recorded in large scale prior to the flood, and then in a smaller trickle of a

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.120
 scale following the flood.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:31.000
 There are at least 277 flood stories from cultures stretching every conceivable part

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.280
 of the globe.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.680
 Some of them bringing you right to the front doorstep of that flood, like the Epic of Gilgamesh

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.880
 from 2700 to 2900 BC.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:50.240
 Every mountain range on earth contains fish fossils, marine life, and even seashells

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.720
 found on top of Mount Everest in the Himalayas.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:04.680
 Extending to include mass beached whale graveyards, turning up in the middle of deserts, like

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:12.560
 this classic example here of the mass whale graveyard in Chile, the most arid desert

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.880
 in the world.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:21.880
 And here's another whale dig site from the other side of the globe, in the sands of Egypt.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:27.880
 Look at the size of that whale buried in that desert there.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:37.720
 Planet and animals are found buried and fossilized in every single layer and strata of the top

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.720
 layers of the earth.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:50.240
 Creatures of every possible kind of animal that we see every day are found mixed in underneath

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:58.080
 the earth, along with mammoth sized creatures, which don't seem to be around anymore.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:05.840
 And these animals of every genre and flavor are often found in mass graveyards, like this

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:14.160
 actual dinosaur graveyard seen on the screen here, as if the animals were herding and whatever

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.360
 happened, happened fast, hit all at once, and was unexpected.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:30.160
 Strangely, when dealing with strata, it is sifted by sediments exactly as one would expect.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:39.160
 There were a lot of water pumping around on the surface of the ground.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:47.360
 One of the enormous challenges of dating anything is that you have to know what the pre-existing

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.280
 conditions were.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:57.800
 For example, this dragonfly fossilized on the screen here has a two and a half foot

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.520
 long wingspan.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.920
 Dragonflies take in perfectly the amount of oxygen that they need to fly.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:13.040
 If one were to assume that atmospheric conditions, oxygen levels and carbon levels in the past

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:20.520
 were like this, when they were actually way up here like this, that would indeed pump

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.080
 out numbers that were very large all across the board.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:36.440
 This dragonfly on the screen could not lift up off the ground and fly today.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:45.000
 We find extremely high oxygen levels in little bitty air bubbles trapped in ancient tree

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 sap.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.840
 Even buried in common things that we might not think about, look at the size of this

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:59.080
 modern day elephant in comparison to this giant animal here, a bronchiosaurus.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:07.200
 Much of this stuff requires an entirely different and much more lush environment.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:15.760
 This elephant is about the size in girth as the base of the neck of this animal.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:23.040
 Bronchiosaurus would have a terribly difficult time lifting its body today.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:30.680
 And that is but one tiny example of an Everest sized mountain of thousands.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:40.920
 The most common method of dating in this present day is using fossils to date geological layers

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.440
 and using geological layers to date fossils.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.820
 Some would call this circular reasoning.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:54.540
 One thing that I find fascinating, not only are there mass burials of animals underground,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:41:00.700
 but there are mass burials of trees going all sorts of different directions.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.100
 Some of them, interestingly enough, going vertical.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:10.980
 What this means is that you would have trees that would have had to have been standing

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:21.540
 up for millions of years while the layers of strata form around the tree.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:30.820
 No one really knows how many of these there actually are buried all over the place underneath

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.320
 the ground.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.820
 This is believed to be the oldest living tree on earth.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:48.460
 Its name is Methuselah and its age is believed to be 4,840 years old, give or take, which

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:55.740
 is interesting because if you're using the Septuagint or the Masoretic texts and even

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:02.820
 using Gilgamesh as well as the Sumerian Kings list as a reference point, you're going to

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:12.760
 come up with a flood date a pinch more than 3,000 BC, maybe a few hundred years more.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:17.100
 And old Methuselah would have been born just a little bit afterwards.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:24.380
 I wasn't there, but I know this, that enormous whales really should not be turning up in

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:33.060
 deserts and thousands and thousands and thousands of seashells should not be backpacking through

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.300
 the Himalayas.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:45.060
 Trees don't generally stand up for tens or hundreds or millions of years while layers

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.900
 of sediments build up around them.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:53.860
 I'm thinking that maybe a real big flood did it.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:43:01.380
 Occasionally I'll hear commentators state that ancient India is tens and tens, sometimes

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.700
 even hundreds of thousands of years old.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:11.900
 And I've tried to chase the rabbit trails on what they mean by that.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.300
 It's not just India.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:24.140
 You'll find this pulling dates out of thin blue sky, particularly in media stuff, a lot.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.540
 I can't find what they're referencing.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:37.900
 The empire of India began following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:45.780
 You begin to see the rise of the first empire of India, the Muryan dynasty.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:55.820
 Going back even further into the far east, the rise of the first dynasty of ancient China,

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:07.780
 the Xia dynasty, its inception at 2000 BC, bringing us full circle to our first empires,

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:14.020
 which would rise right down here in Mesopotamia, where Babylon would become, and the ancient

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:25.140
 city of ancient Uruk, where Gilgamesh ruled, land of the star, which is rested inside of

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:35.100
 the crescent, Babylon and Egypt, the two opening players of occult empires.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:44.100
 right after the flood, and then dropping down right over here, following alongside the Nile

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:52.860
 River banks, where Egypt would become, and where step pyramids and the first attempts

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.620
 at actual pyramids would begin to rise.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:12.420
 Under Djoser, in the third dynasty of Egypt, about 2600 BC, land of the Eye of Horus, and

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:25.460
 disk between the horns of the most ancient, Hathor, both stretches of land dropping down

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:36.780
 along the Fertile Land, the so-called Cradle of Civilization, where little bitty settlements

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:45.420
 would begin to take shape, with your first tiny fortified cities like Uruk, in roughly

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:51.140
 2900 to 3000 BC.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:46:02.300
 Coincidentally, both newly developing locations dropping down from right up here in the same

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:09.100
 area where the boat that saved all mankind is said to have landed.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:17.780
 So those 200 angels covered by Enoch prior to the flood does not represent all of the

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.340
 fallen angels that there are.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:26.440
 It represents a small portion of the total number of fallen angels, the ones which made

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:33.980
 entrance to this place, came in, and interbred with human beings.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:43.540
 This created all sorts of little uglies and unfriendlies, including the giants.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:51.020
 There's also indications in the text that this wasn't necessarily voluntary.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:58.220
 What some of your oldest pages and little bitty scribbles on earth, including Enoch,

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:07.260
 in full detail, are telling you is that before that flood, something unfriendly made entrance

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:15.020
 to this place, and was genetically breeding itself, creating its own offspring, turning

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:24.620
 mankind into a blood-bathed circus of its own unimaginable and twisted design, spreading

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:33.900
 like a virus generation after generation after generation for more than a thousand years,

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:42.260
 until the flood came along, wiping the slate clean, taking everything back down to zero.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:51.820
 But then afterwards, another little bitty door opened, and perhaps what was in the past

00:47:51.820 --> 00:48:00.020
 might slowly creep its way back in for a final show.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:08.380
 It's my extremely strong opinion that the bulk of the hundreds of truly strange bones

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:17.340
 and enormous skulls unlike man in this video came after the ancient flood.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:25.460
 Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:31.780
 Genesis 6, 4, breeding generations.

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:40.220
 Look at the scope of the size of this child's head.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.660
 And then breeding even more generations.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:54.940
 The size of the eye sockets are enormous, moving up this large skull, and then dropping

00:48:54.940 --> 00:49:00.140
 down to breed some more generations.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:08.940
 And here's another little baby one, and then breeding even more than that.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:20.740
 And look at the eye sockets in comparison to the size of the skull atop that tiny skeleton.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:33.340
 Enoch 7, 3, and when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and began

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.700
 to devour mankind.

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:40.540
 It really is absolutely astounding.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:50.940
 It's almost impossible to believe that what you're looking at really is real.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:56.820
 This one commonly gets called the Royal Redhead.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:10.340
 A special thank you to Brian Forrester, as well as his team in Paracas, Peru for making

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:18.700
 the footage, as well as the elongated skulls seen in this video available.

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:23.180
 That is one strange head.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:32.180
 Enoch continues, and they began to sin against the birds and the beasts and the reptiles

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.580
 and the fish.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:43.460
 I have absolutely no idea exactly what that means, but it doesn't sound good.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:49.800
 And to devour one another's flesh and drink the very blood.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:58.440
 It is curious that whether in a biological or a spiritual sense that is equally as deep,

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:06.600
 if not deeper, than even the mysterious thing that we call consciousness, which seems in

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:17.640
 a very real way to plug us in to reality at all, there's always something uniquely special

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.560
 about the blood.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.840
 There's an interesting verse that we've all heard in Leviticus 17, 14.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.240
 You've heard it a million times.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:32.040
 The life of all flesh is in the blood.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:39.480
 The real word is actually saying the rock of every sort of flesh that's provided.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.800
 Saying the spirit of the flesh is in its blood, not the life.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.640
 That is being not a poor translation, but a mistranslation.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:58.760
 It is important to note that after death, the blood is no longer usable.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.320
 As if it's lost something.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:12.360
 Every living organism on this planet is constructed of three-dimensional digital coding.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:20.360
 Like zip files, pure data, zero junk code in every single strand.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.240
 Tip for tat, line for line.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:32.360
 Which opens up click by click by click to become a living biological organism.

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:36.200
 All of it fitting together like a perfect glove.

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:45.400
 Deeper inside the genome, the framework of pure biological software and precision operating

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.000
 system.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:56.600
 File folders containing actual body plans, digital instructions coordinating every strand,

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:06.440
 every cell, every little bitty part, pulling the molecular fabric of every piece together

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:12.200
 to create a biological masterpiece.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:24.840
 Literally written, birthed into reality itself from scratch and seemingly plugged in to neurologically

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:35.880
 and consciously control every single system of the entire biological masterpiece.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:44.760
 It's not just consciousness, the intangible controlling the tangible, which is a paradox.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:57.640
 The living blueprint for what you call you is alive in every single drop of your blood.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:04.280
 One could quite easily come to believe that there's something a lot larger in scope going

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.280
 on here.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:18.080
 It does say in Genesis 126 that God himself created mankind in his own image and likeness.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.560
 It's a powerful statement.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:25.920
 When you're dealing with the ancient past or things which may even boggle the minds

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:36.800
 of trained physicians, let no detail, no matter how seemingly trite, slip through the fingertips

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:44.400
 to truly understand Babylon and the time periods lasting to this modern age.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.440
 The more recent past from which these skulls likely come.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:58.560
 One could easily make an extremely strong case that we are merely infants running loose

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:10.480
 in very short term, little bodies, biological machines through which we peer out consciously

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:16.080
 into this thing that we call the material world, built and constructed right out of

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:22.960
 thin air by digital coding, light years more sophisticated in each and every single strand

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:29.040
 than all of the computer software made by man combined all the way back to the very

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.320
 first computer.

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:38.560
 What the pages of Enoch are saying, as well as the Hebrew texts and cultures all across

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:48.000
 this globe, is that something has tried to plug itself in and insert itself into all of that.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:57.040
 Enoch is not just talking about a set of very dark fallen beings and producing their own

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.240
 hybrid children.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.960
 It goes a lot deeper than that.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:09.840
 What he's telling you is that these fallen angels which produced the Nephilim, neither

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:17.360
 completely angel or completely human, but something in between.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:23.520
 So what he's literally saying is when they die, their souls come out from the race of

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:30.480
 giants that came from this union, gave way to a brood of evil spirits, and those are

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.840
 the foul spirits of the earth, the demons.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:42.880
 The Nephilim die, they become or get added to the number of demons, beings which later

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:53.840
 cultures would call the underworld gods, the shadow creatures from all of the ages of history.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:00.960
 Beings and creatures that can possibly bleed through from a realm that might be just as

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.920
 close as the air between your fingertips.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:11.520
 Now it is always eggs and semen that things like this are after, right?

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.440
 Or be summonsed.

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.800
 Notice the little baby down there in the image.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:23.360
 There's a big part of me that thinks that that thing there might not ultimately want

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.640
 to be friends.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:30.480
 Almost like whatever it is, it's close enough it can see you.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.400
 Enoch used the term, the watchers.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:41.680
 But in terms of evil, the deeper, darker, more twisted and macabre, the better.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:46.160
 And the higher the place of the carnage.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.080
 These aren't fallen angels.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:52.640
 If he casts them out, the fallen angels can go, they can go to the high places.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.080
 But these aren't fallen angels.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.680
 These are demons.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.120
 These are Raphael.

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.400
 These are dead in the film.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.960
 Don't forget that I brought up the high places.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:06.160
 Sure is a lot of red way up there in this drawing.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:13.360
 The more vicious and brutal, the more bloody yet venomous, terrifying and precise.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.560
 The ceremony as if intoxicating things that dwell in the darkness.

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:26.400
 One of the most respected names in the field of ufology, his opinion shared by notable

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:32.000
 others such as J. Allen Hynek, was none other than Dr. Jacques Vallee.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:39.520
 Instrumental in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:47.200
 Commonly stated, his belief that the UFO phenomenon was in fact demonic.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:56.480
 Human beings are under the control of a strange force that bends them in absurd ways, forcing

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:01.840
 them to play a role in a bizarre game of deception.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:09.280
 Was Alistair Crowley, a self-proclaimed black magician at the top of a great many of the

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.880
 most predominant secret societies.

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:20.480
 To give the first drawing during the 20th century of one of these large-headed entities,

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:26.400
 a character that Crowley claimed stepped through into physical reality.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:31.520
 This entity would ultimately become what Crowley would describe as a spiritual.

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:40.820
 guide to him after an extensive battery of very intense black magic rituals. You

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:45.780
 may find some similarities between Crowley's drawing and thousands if not

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:52.060
 tens of thousands of other such entities drawn by people from every walk

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:58.620
 of life all around the globe. Crowley is quoted as stating, today they

00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:05.500
 call them angels and demons, tomorrow they'll call them something else. The UFO

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:12.420
 phenomenon simply does not behave like extraterrestrial visitors. It actually

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:22.820
 molds itself in order to fit a given culture. John Ankerberg, John Dee, the head

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:28.740
 intelligence officer under Queen Elizabeth in the 1500s, he would do the

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:35.660
 deepest of interlayer occult rituals, popularizing such ideas as the crystal

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:41.580
 ball, alchemy, and the philosopher's stone. These long hours of ritual occult on

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:47.500
 behalf of the Empire of England were done with fellow black magician Edward

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:53.180
 Kelly. Kelly would ultimately leap to his death from a castle tower window.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:01:01.100
 John Dee, however, would go on to catalog extensive lists, meticulously detailing

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:08.620
 out a vast array of entities, which he claimed not only could communicate but

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:15.540
 could also physically step right through into the material world itself. Though the

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:21.740
 public position and statement of the Empire was that Dee was communicating

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:28.820
 with angels, Dee's diary discovered following his death told a different

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:35.300
 story, recording that the entities were becoming more and more evil. Notice the

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:40.300
 serpents, stating more and more emphatically, these things are lying to

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:48.420
 me, they're not angels, they're demons. UFOanauts and the demons of past days are

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:57.740
 probably identical. Dr. Pierre Guerin, in looking at accounts of claimed aliens,

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:09.060
 all roads seem to lead to the occult. More specifically, either Egyptian or

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:17.820
 Babylonian. Ephesians 612, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, the

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:26.700
 claimed mystery religions themselves, but against principalities, powers, rulers of

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:34.340
 darkness. Whether you're talking about something that just appears in the skies,

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:43.580
 spiritual wickedness in high places, which really does beg the question, where

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:49.700
 is it when you don't see it? One theory which can no longer be taken very

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:57.860
 seriously, is that UFOs are interstellar spaceships. With Sir Arthur C. Clarke, or

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:04.540
 physically step through into this reality, your ancient texts are taking

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:12.540
 you at least ten steps further down the rabbit hole than that. I have yet to meet

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:19.180
 one person who has come out of the occult that does not have, in some cases,

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:26.260
 terrifying and extremely tangible and real accounts to give. I also find it

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:30.900
 particularly interesting when I've gotten to sit down with people who have

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:36.900
 had life-after-death experiences, most especially if they were legally dead for any

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.940
 number of minutes and have actual medical records. Hell, or ancient Sheol,

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:45.660
 whether it be from someone in the occult or someone from an after-death

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:51.860
 experience, some strikingly eerie similarities. These bland, sort of

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:57.820
 expressionless, pull-you-in type characters, with sort of varying degrees

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:06.900
 of sinister evilness. Described almost like a diminished alternate version of

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:14.580
 Earth, that the person steps as if the ground level is being described as lower

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:21.940
 or different, or falls right inside of. With things that literally grab hold and

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:29.420
 herd the people into actual pit-like cages, wherein at that point the

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:36.060
 descriptions of the creatures get even worse. Things much more disturbing and

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:43.580
 twisted than what may channel in. To be portrayed as physical artwork and

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:50.980
 representations of something through the imaginations and the minds of men.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:05:00.860
 Ephesians 2.2, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:09.580
 What fascinates me is when people look up and they describe, and the ruler of

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:17.340
 the kingdom of the air, like these Sky City type of apparatuses. It's a spirit

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:26.940
 who is now at work in the suns of disobedience. Sort of hover in a murky or

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:34.460
 black, dark, scarred horizon. Whether in personal accounts or even in Enoch, you

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:41.140
 get these hints of things that are in the air and things that are that are

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:46.580
 moving. But diving below, where the people are quickly snatched and drugged to the

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:52.580
 side by the apparent welcoming teams. They'll talk about a lot of serpents

01:05:52.580 --> 01:06:00.820
 ranging from enormous creatures to these more or less human-sized things. Often

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:07.100
 with man-like or human-like features similar to the wisdom serpents or

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:15.940
 serpent gods found in every single major ancient culture with uncanny

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:22.540
 similarities. Look at that big old serpent crawling inside of the crescent

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:29.900
 shaped moon between the two Babylonian Ishtar stars. I do believe you're gonna

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:37.820
 find the serpents like the one these three fine fellas are praying to in

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:45.340
 nearly every belief and religion on earth. The serpents, no matter what size

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:50.460
 or shape they're described as, just like any of the other characters within the

01:06:50.460 --> 01:07:00.580
 place, always have this ancient old one, yet vicious and precise, kind of highly

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:07.340
 intelligent twist. It's also noteworthy to point out the similarities

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:13.900
 historically of bones or warped protrusion like horns is in this

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:21.300
 recreation of Egyptian artwork. Notice the extra set of horns on top is empty

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:27.540
 whereas in this rendering between the horns you've got this little disc

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:33.740
 resting on top. An environment described at the core of its beating heart,

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:39.980
 decrepit almost with this vibe of mechanical madness combined with living

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:45.740
 dead organism of tentacles and fangs. What some might have been calling the

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:51.940
 second heaven, the said diminished realm well beneath heaven and decrepit much

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:58.220
 more than the earth. Littered with sophisticated type things in its skies

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:05.300
 where the fallen angel, Lucifer himself, is said to rule for a short spance.

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:14.460
 Almost like hitting the show code key to the virus side of reality and cavernous

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:20.860
 needing a breath and a drop of water flames. Probably the most terrifying part

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:30.380
 of all of it is that the things there wanted you there in their clutches for

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:39.140
 some reason. It's a prison that collects things that no one will ever come to

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:47.660
 help. I'm not going to physically or personally go in to check any of that

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:55.020
 out. I'm willing to take other people's word for it. Was Jesus Christ who

01:08:55.020 --> 01:09:02.900
 described heaven as a place full of many mansions and likened hell to this

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:11.340
 actual place here, Gehenna, outside of Jerusalem where the trash was burned.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:20.460
 He was giving this analogy to common men, to sheep herders, couched in a way that

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:28.260
 they could understand it. As if the human body itself is nothing more than a shell,

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:37.220
 a vessel, a confining temporal instrument binding one to a specific location in

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:43.860
 both time and space. Of those who have tried to describe heaven, though there

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:51.820
 are so many from every possible age range, background, and culture. Enoch's

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:58.500
 pre-flood account is extremely precise. People commonly talk about this unusual

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:07.020
 event called the rapture in the Bible. There are technically seven of them by my

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:17.420
 count. Enoch is the first one on that list and he is the seventh from Adam.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:24.060
 I wonder if that has a meaning. He stumbles for words at least a dozen

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:31.620
 times in his document stating to you, I wish I could describe what I'm looking

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:40.100
 at. And then afterwards talking about this place as if it doesn't even feel

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:47.700
 real anymore. Now to understand these things called Nephilim, or the origins of

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:54.660
 physical evil, it's important to recognize the entire scope. But perhaps before taking a

01:10:54.660 --> 01:11:01.100
 critical look at that pre-flood world of Genesis, or the kings with enormous

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:08.460
 lifespans before the worldwide flood in the Sumerian Kings list, or analyzing the

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:15.260
 pages of Enoch, great-grandfather of Noah, I want you to notice the Greek Titan.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:22.540
 Creatures part God, part man in this image with his arms like a crescent

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:29.500
 holding the large disk in the middle. Same as what Gilgamesh claimed he was in

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:34.860
 the Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest written epic on the face of the planet

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:42.500
 Earth. The Titans, the sons of Saturn, or sons of Satan. And this isn't just Babylon

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:50.380
 or ancient Sumeria, the place of the Anunnaki, the biblical sons of Enoch.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:58.460
 Kings and rulers of ages past reaching out their hands to summons the deepest

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:05.180
 regions of darkness in an effort to beckon things that bite the very hand

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:13.580
 that feeds into this place. The sacrifice of little children, deeply seeded,

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:20.900
 derangement, shedding of innocent blood to Moloch or Baal, working darkness into a

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:27.660
 frenzy, playing the drums louder to drown out the screams. Almost like a virus

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:35.220
 reaching out to grab its own desires through an extremely naive host. To mass

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:42.780
 ritualistic human sacrifice. Notice up here above that the serpent is waiting.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:48.820
 It's almost as if the idea is that they're feeding something. That the

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:55.380
 moment his eyes roll closed that there's something on the other side waiting for

01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:02.860
 him to come through. Notice how the serpent is used as encapsulation. As if

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:09.980
 to define ownership. It says something really fascinating in Genesis 3.15 right

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:16.300
 after the eating of the fruit and the serpent in the garden. It says, I will put

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:24.060
 anemone between you, the serpent, and the woman. The serpent is coming out from the

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:31.260
 forehead, the place where the third eye or the mind's eye would be placed. The eye

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:38.940
 of Horus or the all-seeing eye floating mysteriously above the pyramid of bricks

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:44.740
 built by men. As a side note, it is curious how strikingly similar the eye

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:52.900
 of Horus looks in comparison to a human penile gland inside the brain and

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:59.500
 dimensionally peering into this world through the glass darkly. And of course

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:06.260
 the Inca with the symbol of this little bitty owl sort of peering through. And

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:15.620
 between your offspring, the seed of the serpent, and her offspring, he shall bruise

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:24.460
 your head and you shall bruise his heel. Now take a good look at these symbols

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:30.940
 that look like little horns with a circle inside them.

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:34.620
 on top of the head of these two serpents.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:39.420
 Here's an enormous version of the same symbol.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:43.580
 You're going to find quite a lot of these in ancient Egypt,

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.580
 perhaps quite often on the head of an Egyptian goddess.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.660
 And there's the little serpent.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.620
 But it doesn't always have to be represented like that.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.740
 For example, this golden cow's head here.

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.220
 See here, even the cow's got a little serpent

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:06.220
 with the two ears or horns that make sort of a cradle.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:11.220
 Stars always representing angels inside of it

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:16.220
 with the sun shining light out from behind the ears

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.280
 inside of the cradle.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.480
 But the sun also sort of looks like it makes

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.040
 an eye-shaped appearance going around it

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.520
 or a crescent moon with a star.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.920
 Now, when you're talking about stars,

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.920
 like this large representation of a Babylonian Ishtar

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.220
 sitting couched inside of its crescent,

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.800
 the stars, when used in ancient texts,

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.800
 are extremely often symbolism for angels

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.360
 or perhaps even a very particular fallen angel.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:59.040
 The answer goes all the way back to the Temple of Hathor,

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.560
 to the megacomplex of Dendera.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.560
 Hathor goes all the way back to King Narmer himself

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.160
 in Dynasty Zero.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.280
 That's King Narmer right there from the Narmer Pallet

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.840
 found in the Temple of Horus.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.840
 Notice up here the long crown on the head of the king

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.840
 and at the top of the pallet of the first king of Egypt,

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.320
 the first symbol of the face of Hathor,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.800
 a literal temple for storing the history

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.800
 all the way back to the inception of ancient Egypt itself

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:45.800
 with the symbol of Hathor crowned atop the serpent's heads.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.800
 The Egyptians believed that the kingship of all Egypt

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.960
 started with one named Osiris,

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.960
 a dead man who would be brought back to life by Isis.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:04.960
 Osiris would be infilled and reanimated

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.420
 by the spirit of an underworld god.

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:13.300
 Notice the wings on the goddess

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.700
 and then up over here, the little horns

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.300
 with the disc in the center.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.540
 The flesh of the reanimated Osiris

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:27.180
 is generally a murky bluish green.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:30.820
 This union of a resurrected dead man

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:34.700
 and a winged creature would give birth

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:38.180
 to what they called Horus.

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:41.120
 Notice the disc in this image

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.300
 no longer is encapsulated with horns

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:50.300
 but instead is simply wrapped with a serpent.

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:55.300
 This shape is not two horns.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:59.540
 It's the shape of a woman's womb

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:04.140
 which is why it's on the head of a fertility goddess

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:09.140
 and the solar disc or sun disc in the center

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:14.140
 is just like the star was for the Babylonians

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:19.140
 and the sun in their hieroglyphs is owned by the serpent,

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:24.140
 the symbol for the ruler of the air.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:29.140
 Inside the crescent, the birth canal

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:33.500
 or the moon being represented in the feminine

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:38.500
 in which the sun symbolically has rested inside of

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:43.500
 and producing Horus, the new little eye

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:47.980
 that is peering through and watching.

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.060
 Notice down here the serpent

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.460
 again with the little disc on its head.

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:57.860
 In fact, at the entrance to the Temple of Hathor

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:01.600
 where this enormous symbol is,

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.420
 there are actually 17 little bitty serpents

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:10.740
 underneath that humongous symbol.

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.860
 It's like a little identifier.

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:16.220
 This plus this equals this.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.180
 It's like a post-it note for the ancient beast

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.220
 popped right on top of their heads.

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:24.080
 Move out of the way, we're making underworld gods here.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.620
 All right, they're a bunch of demons

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:31.620
 and of course, serpents in every possible

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.140
 and spiritual sense.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.780
 Whatever may have been the exact details

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:41.780
 of what the Egyptians were trying so dearly to express,

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:44.940
 the underworld gods are not being displayed

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:49.940
 as just basic common day-to-day knowledge on their walls

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:54.940
 but more than that, the focal point of the entire empire.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:57.600
 It was an oppressive place.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.200
 Here's a character from the walls of Egypt

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.960
 that you may recognize

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.880
 or perhaps you're more familiar with his updated version,

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.720
 the star in the middle of the two horns.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.640
 We've even got two serpents down here coming out.

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.600
 The Goat of Mendes.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.600
 This text is from the Egyptians' most treasured document,

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.840
 the Book of the Dead, chapter 175,

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.760
 where Autumn would later combine with Autumn Ra,

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.760
 here enlisted as the high supreme god, states this.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:39.080
 Then I will be what will remain,

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.240
 just I and Asur,

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:46.240
 when I will have changed myself back into the old serpent

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.240
 who knew no man and saw no god.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.440
 The pain, poverty, and hardship of common people

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.380
 does seem to follow that star.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:03.380
 Cambodia, you have the Naga serpent kings.

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:08.380
 In Hindu, Vishnu sleeps in the cosmos.

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:12.340
 Nirvana with the serpents.

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:15.580
 Perhaps King Solomon was right.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:18.340
 There's nothing new under the sun.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.060
 Most all ancient cultures,

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:24.980
 particularly Babylon and ancient Egypt,

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.540
 believed that their gods,

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:32.080
 which could be physically summonsed to manifest,

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.280
 were in the underworld.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:39.280
 When you hear Luciferians and the cultists

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.280
 throughout every age talking about the ability

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.000
 to summons little spookies,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.360
 things that most certainly do not have

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.440
 your best interest at heart,

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.960
 or entities, very tangible things,

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.520
 not only does it hate you,

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.160
 it wishes that it could be you.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.720
 It's my extremely strong opinion

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.200
 that they are not making that up.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.360
 This was believed to be a dimension

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:21.360
 running parallel, side by side with the earth,

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.800
 and equally as real,

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.040
 a place full of hate, anger, bondage, terror,

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.760
 total lack and despair,

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.640
 place where mankind is herded up

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:38.640
 and cast to the fangs of a vast array of frightening things.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.500
 But in the very halls of pentacles of power

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.620
 throughout the ages of earth,

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:49.020
 men from nearly every age of empire,

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:51.500
 both great to small,

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:56.260
 in pursuit of mankind's age-old hangups,

01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.700
 lust, greed, power,

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:03.620
 or the really big one that goes all the way back

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:07.060
 to the serpent in the garden itself,

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.540
 ye shall become as gods.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.180
 Softly whispered lies,

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:19.020
 almost like the whole thing is a test,

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.940
 trinkets in exchange for everything.

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:26.780
 Now, if we go back just a pinch before

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:31.780
 the first step pyramid in Egypt under Djoser,

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:36.780
 and I hop back over here to the land of Ur,

01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:40.240
 Samaria, later Babylon,

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.800
 to the little tiny settlement of Uruk,

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:47.400
 called by many the oldest city in the world,

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.400
 and by some the rising New York City of the ancient world,

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.440
 is just outside ancient Uruk,

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.340
 where Nimrod, the first king,

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.800
 the one recorded as having been in defiance

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.160
 to the Lord God,

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:07.760
 one of the great, great grandsons of Noah,

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.760
 drawn here deified in this 4,000-year-old recreation

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.040
 of an artifact, an artwork, from ancient Nineveh,

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.920
 or in the Samarian writings,

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.920
 the legend of Enmerkar, the king of Uruk,

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:28.240
 who actually built the great tower

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.560
 that has come to be known in history

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.520
 as the Tower of Babel.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.440
 The name meant Gate of the God.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.000
 You can view the Tower of Babel

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
 like one enormous mega-invocation ritual.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.280
 They're recorded as inviting something from the darkness

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.000
 to step up from its lair.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.200
 Was it that point that they described something

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:00.200
 sort of human-like entered?

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:04.000
 2 Corinthians 11.14,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
 even Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.920
 The Samarians called it the Enki,

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.000
 as seen on this actual inscription.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.240
 He's making entrance through this little doorway

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.240
 with these lines around it,

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.680
 surrounded by these two characters

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:34.240
 with heads that look something like this.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:39.160
 And the Enki was called the Lord of Earth,

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:44.160
 the Giver of Knowledge, or the Morning Star.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:49.160
 Sometimes the word, abzu, or the symbolism,

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.120
 like these little wiggly lines here,

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.920
 gets translated as waters.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.320
 That's not quite correct.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.320
 The word abzu means abyss,

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.080
 which is where the Enki, being summonsed here,

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.640
 is coming forth out of.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.680
 This stretching scape of land right here

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.440
 is believed to be the remains and ruins

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.160
 of the Tower of Babel,

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.960
 the place where in either the Samarian texts

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.080
 or the biblical texts,

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.080
 the tongues were confused and the people began to fan out,

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.520
 or the ancient Ziggurat of Eridu,

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.520
 just 12 kilometers outside of Ur.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.520
 And of course, the very word Babel today means confusion.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:52.520
 If you take all of your pages and hours of history,

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:56.640
 you're dealing with a tale of two cities,

01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.640
 Israel and Babylon, spiritual light,

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.080
 or conversely, spiritual darkness.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:10.080
 Everything in this place has a lower level meaning

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.760
 and a higher level meaning.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.520
 After the Hebrews left Egypt,

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:20.240
 the land of Osiris-Ra, the Eye of Horus,

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.440
 and entered Sinai following the plagues of Egypt

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.160
 and the parting of the Red Sea,

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.400
 the Ark of the Covenant and the Mercy Seat

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.720
 between the wings of the two archangels,

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.640
 placing the Ark inside the Holy of Holies

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.640
 at the very center of the temple

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.200
 where the high priest would go in once a year

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.680
 and he would sprinkle the blood of atonement

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.320
 on the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.960
 Speaking of power in the blood,

01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.960
 I understand, Troy, Moses wrote this

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.840
 2,000 years before Yeshua was born,

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.160
 before Jesus was born and crucified.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.920
 So when you say God's sacred name

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:12.000
 and the high priest was sprinkling blood

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
 on the Ark of the Covenant

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.440
 and saying God's holy sacred name,

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.080
 sprinkling blood on the Ark,

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.680
 he would be saying Yahweh, Yod-Heh-Vol-Heh,

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:29.000
 and the word picture is behold the hand, behold the nail.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
 Once a year in the center of the tabernacle in the heart,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
 that's the unspeakable name of God, by the way,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.840
 in the Holy of Holies,

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.080
 while putting the blood on the Ark of the Covenant,

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.000
 the high priest sprinkling the blood once a year

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.840
 would be saying.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:59.020
 behold the hand, behold the nail. Surrounded by the encampment of all of

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:05.880
 the Israelite tribes. God gave some very tedious instructions on the setup of

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:11.320
 this camp in the wilderness with the Levite priests dead in the center. In

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:18.080
 fact itemizing out what the exact population numbers were of each of the

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:24.560
 tribes that were camping. Sometimes the most curious things are buried right in

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:31.680
 plain sight. I saved some time for you. This is what exactly that camp would

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:39.520
 have looked like. Does the shape of that precisely calculated out layout look

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.960
 familiar? This image here is precisely what the shape of the Israelite camp

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:52.760
 would have looked like. Of course the Levites and the tabernacle itself were

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:59.720
 right in the center, the heart right there. And deeper inside that middle in

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:05.280
 the heart of the holiest of holies where the priest would stand before the mercy

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:14.040
 seat itself and say the unspeakable name of God. Behold the hand, behold the nail.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:23.160
 This is more than 1,500 years before Jesus Christ. It was a moving cross out there

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.560
 on the desert floor that would have been so mesmerizing to have seen looking down

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:34.360
 with all the little campfires going from the sky at night. Let's see if we can

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:42.680
 take that a step deeper. Curiously if you take the names from Adam all the way

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:51.160
 down to Noah in the book of Genesis and you look at the root meaning of those

01:30:51.160 --> 01:31:00.560
 names, this is what it reads. Man appointed mortal sorrow. The blessed God

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:12.240
 shall come down teaching. His death shall bring the despairing rest and comfort.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:19.760
 You'd have a terrible time convincing me that some Hebrew scribes concocted that

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:26.520
 in the Genesis text. Nonetheless let's go deeper than that. Pre-flood book of Enoch.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:33.680
 He goes further than just fallen angels and hybrid offspring. Enoch is

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:40.480
 redundantly prophesying the coming of this Son of Man, laying out that at a

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:48.240
 time in the future not only will what has been done be undone, but further that

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:57.640
 through his name they shall be saved. There are at least 365 extremely

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:05.920
 specific prophecies of the coming of that child and the sacrifice of a Savior.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:12.480
 The Passover began before the final plague in Egypt before the Israelite

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:22.000
 slaves marched out of the largest empire on earth, fulfilling every single rule of

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:30.440
 a Passover sacrifice no less. And before the final plague of Egypt they were to

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:38.120
 put the blood of the Passover lamb on their doorpost. Curious what meanings

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.160
 can be found in things when you're willing to scratch. One curious detail,

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:48.840
 the symbol of the Tav during any Canaanite or pre-Canaanite time period

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:58.340
 would have looked something like this. It is true that the ancient Tav, meaning

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:07.780
 sign or mark, perhaps covenant, looks something exactly like this. Crucifixion

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:15.540
 would not even become a practice until five ages of empires later under the

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:23.700
 Romans. It is interesting that the blood would be saving their firstborn sons,

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:32.260
 while God would be giving up his. In fact, even done on Passover day while the

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:41.340
 kings of earth were throwing babies onto open fire pits and flames, sparing no

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:49.220
 expense to build the grandest of towers and ziggurats to feed darkness their

01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:56.180
 subjects lives. To satisfy and appease the unending thirst of their little bitty

01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:04.580
 otherworldly underworld gods. Something tells me that in a minute here the

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:11.980
 underworld gods and the shadow people are gonna have a role to play in all

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:21.460
 this before we get to the end. What greater love could one have than to lay

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:30.140
 down their life for their friends. Here's the empty tomb where Jesus was for three

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:40.020
 days. That 365 specific prophecies about Jesus Christ by no means includes the

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:45.820
 fabric of patterns. There are at least four times that many for the second

01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:53.900
 coming. The hours when all the old scorecards get tallied up than there are

01:34:53.900 --> 01:35:01.860
 for the first. Restoration and the entrance and return of the king. But out

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:07.860
 of all of those prophecies there's only one other person other than Enoch who

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:15.140
 used this term son of man. That would have been Daniel who survived the lion's

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:22.540
 den. Well in the very heart of Babylon no less. It's astounding how these things

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:28.860
 work out. Was Daniel who interpreted the king of Babylon Nebuchadnezzar's dream of

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:36.540
 the five empires leading to the end including Nebuchadnezzar's own and not

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:42.500
 including the two before it. That makes a total of seven. I wonder if that means

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:49.260
 anything. But an angel would appear in the later years of Daniel's life. More

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:55.780
 specifically Gabriel the same angel that came to Mary prior to the birth of Jesus

01:35:55.780 --> 01:36:03.140
 Christ as well as believed to be an angel at the tomb after the resurrection.

01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:10.420
 And not only give him a tit-for-tat sentence by sentence line for line

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:16.180
 walkthrough of coming history and we know that none of that precision was

01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:22.820
 done after the fact because the Septuagint which included Daniel was put

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:31.300
 together under Ptolemy during the third century BC as is seen in Daniel 11

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:36.820
 beginning with the kings of the north and the kings of the south the Seleucid

01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.500
 and Ptolemaic empires predicting even the unlikely rise of the little-known

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:48.980
 underdog which would later come to be known as the Empire of Rome. Those are

01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:56.060
 some really impressive guesses but by far the most impressive of the entire

01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:04.580
 bunch is that Daniel would predict the exact day and date that Jesus Christ

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:12.820
 would enter the front gate of Jerusalem on the back of a donkey fulfilling

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:19.500
 Zechariah 9 9 that the people rejoice as the King cometh on the back of a foul

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:29.700
 donkey. This would be the 10th of Nisan or more precisely April 6th 32 AD four

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:36.180
 days before the crucifixion. Daniel is giving you the exact starting point.

01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:45.700
 Daniel 9 25 states know and understand this from the time that the word goes

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:58.140
 out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed one the King comes

01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:07.620
 the date that a Persian king gave the decree of Artaxerxes on March 14th 445

01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:16.620
 BC to restore and rebuild Jerusalem after the Persians had defeated Babylon

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:25.380
 in exactly the way by exactly the guy Cyrus that Isaiah had predicted 200

01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:35.260
 years in advance. Countdown leading to the precise day and writing this more

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:43.060
 than 500 years in advance. It brings new meaning to when Jesus Christ told the

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:50.340
 Pharisees you think that in those scriptures you have eternal life but

01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:59.260
 it's those very pages that speak of me. Because of the mass reports of healings

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:06.500
 and blind eyes open on many occasions the masses had wanted to make him king

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:14.380
 but he never allowed them to praise him and declare him out as king until one

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:21.060
 very particular day that Daniel had given the math for more than 500 years

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:27.500
 in advance. Arriving at the front gate of Jerusalem the religious leaders the

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:34.940
 Pharisees told Jesus you have to shut these people up this is heresy. Jesus

01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:43.260
 replied to the Pharisees if I were to silence these people indeed I tell you

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:51.060
 even the rocks of this place would cry out. If you do the math from the decree

01:39:51.060 --> 01:40:00.300
 of Artaxerxes to the triumphant entry this point here 69 times 7 times 360

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:06.140
 using the identical calendar system of the ancient world most especially

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:12.140
 Babylon making provision for the 24 day difference between March 14th and April

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:17.380
 6th as well as your hundred and sixteen days added in for leap years you're

01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:25.660
 gonna come up to exactly 173,880 days. On the money Daniel's

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:33.900
 margin of error more than 500 years beforehand from that angel's lips was

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:42.900
 precisely zero. But if I hop backwards much before Daniel before even the young

01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:50.340
 David stamped into the pages of history for the highly unusual miraculous

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:59.580
 defeat of a six-fingered giant named Goliath. But going back past even David

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:06.580
 the one often called a man after God's own heart beyond the days in the

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:13.940
 wilderness then even the time in Egypt back to our first little starting gate

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:23.300
 cultures down here in Egypt and over here in Samaria the place of ancient

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:30.740
 Uruk to where Gilgamesh depicted here his statue ruled right here to the land

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:40.420
 an area of Ur. Now that is a giant holding a lion right? Where Abraham the

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:47.740
 father of all the future children of Israel was living. Many believe that

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:54.660
 Abraham could see the base of the Tower of Babel while growing up. And then it

01:41:54.660 --> 01:42:03.660
 begins a little something like this. Get thee out of thy country and from thy

01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:14.060
 kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show unto thee.

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:22.100
 Abraham would ultimately travel over here to exactly where modern-day

01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:30.100
 Jerusalem is. And I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:37.220
 make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:47.100
 bless thee and curse them that curseth thee. That's a very big promise. One night

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:54.900
 he woke up with hot sweats and horrors that the Lord had shown him that his

01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:04.540
 descendants would be slaves in a foreign land for 400 years but that God himself

01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:16.900
 said that he would judge that nation. And in thee shall all the families of the

01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:29.140
 earth be blessed. Genesis 12 1 through 3. What those pages are telling you is that

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:40.420
 the Hebrews, Israel, was the delivery system for the Savior of all mankind.

01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:45.900
 Leading full circle to the most well-known passage in the whole

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:48.940
 masquerade

01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:57.560
 of particles that makes up the planet earth. For God so loved the world that he

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:10.300
 gave his one and only Son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but

01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:19.780
 have everlasting and eternal life. And every single possible thing short of the

01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:26.740
 kitchen sink tried to stand in the way of that. What those pages are saying, all

01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:33.340
 of them, is that you, no matter who you are on the other side of the screen, were

01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:41.860
 born above even the angels. Someone asked me the other day how I truly thought

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:50.220
 that the entire universe was held together. I was stumped by the question.

01:44:50.220 --> 01:45:01.580
 Here's my answer. It's love. Totally undeserved love. Never listen to snakes

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:13.220
 because they're snakes. You were born to be free in every possible sense in both

01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:22.100
 this life and the next. It's my extremely strong opinion that the shadow people

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:29.780
 are not your friends. Go on your own journey to ask these very same questions.

01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:38.980
 Your life is worth that. Oh, before I forget, Jesus did say another thing to

01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:49.660
 his disciples. In Matthew 24 it says, So it was in the days of Noah, so also shall

01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:59.940
 it be in the day of the return of the Son of Man. One can only wonder what

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:08.620
 exactly that might mean. It is true that the grand finale of any fireworks show

01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:17.940
 is always at the end. I'm Trey Smith and I hope you enjoyed the video. Here's some

01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:26.660
 fireworks for you of the friendly kind. Look at how that skull actually does

01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:36.540
 have an enormous skull cap on the back. That it is genetically different in its

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:45.620
 bone structure than a human skull. It's not just that the head is longer, it's

01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:52.260
 actually got a different structure. Coming this winter, soon or maybe even

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.860
 available now, depending on when you're watching this video, all the Nephilim

01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:00.820
 video you just watched on DVD in high quality with over 45 minutes of extra

01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:05.900
 commentary with Trey Smith on Nephilim, aliens, demons and the coming future. A

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:10.220
 DVD you won't want to miss. We are not responsible for any Nephilim which may

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:15.580

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:28.780
 well as Brian Forrester for providing the video footage of the elongated

01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:37.460
 skulls that you saw inside the Nephilim video, as well as to Rabbi Brian Hall who

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:46.660
 provided much more information than was possibly covered in the few clips where

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:53.460
 he was talking, as well as Rick Hummer and also the largest dedication of the

01:47:53.460 --> 01:48:01.260
 entire video to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ without whom this video would not

01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:07.340
 have been possible at all had I not been able to hit my knees every single morning

01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:10.340
 and talk to him before I started doing any one of these clips.

01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:15.380

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:49.020
 become a writer on Godinanutshell.com. And I am the author of Thieves, One Dirty

01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:56.220
 TV Pastor and the Man Who Robbed Him. This is a true story. In 1999, when I was

01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:03.140
 a stupid kid, I committed a safe robbery on a television pastor named Mike

01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:09.780
 Murdoch. This is an article done by D Magazine about the book. That's me down

01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:14.580
 there running from Mike Murdoch with the safe on my back. This is Mike with his

01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:19.740
 standard goatee up there coming through there. To me, it all sort of feels like it

01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:24.220
 happened in a different life at this point through the television screen. He

01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:31.860
 looks a little bit angry in that picture there. But if you're curious what could

01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:36.460
 happen to a man's mind that would drive him to commit a safe robbery on a

01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:43.700
 television pastor and then end up in the desert of Mexico, you're in luck. Here's

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:50.060
 some clips. Thieves by Trey Smith. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, anywhere books are sold.

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:56.100
 I've been on radio and TV for 20 years. And Trey, first, as far as the book

01:50:56.100 --> 01:51:01.900
 itself, I'll give you an example. My producer, Will Duffy, his wife, Danielle,

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:08.020
 was in the hospital to give birth. And they had some time. So Will is reading

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:15.980
 aloud Thieves. And not only his wife becomes addicted to it, but people in

01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:22.260
 neighboring beds, neighboring rooms, all sat in to listen to Thieves being read.

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:28.660
 It's like Danielle wanted to delay labor because she was so fascinated. Thieves was

01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:34.500
 me pouring literally my heart out day after day. These were all written in a

01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:39.060
 jail cell. And guards used to pay me when they were on ship, they would give me

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:45.340
 extra lunch trays to read them this book. So Thieves was originally paid for. But

01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:50.580
 jailhouse lunch trays. And then after the safe robbery, when I'm on the run

01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:56.140
 from a television pastor in Mexico, it really kicks into high octane. Sometimes

01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:02.860
 I would just stop and say to myself, there's not a lot of really great ways

01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:14.220
 for any of this to end. Crazy as it seems, though, it did all well. I promise.

01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:20.420
 Thank God for that. I'm pretty certain that you're not gonna find anything like

01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:20.860
 this

01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:21.340
 anywhere.
