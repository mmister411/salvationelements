2,00:00:14.000,00:00:19.000,5.0," I thought I would try to touch on as many video request topics as I could in this video,"
3,00:00:19.000,00:00:25.000,6.0," including the Phoenicians, Aryans, Israelites and Lost Tribes,"
4,00:00:25.000,00:00:29.000,4.0," the Ashkenazi, Noah and his sons,"
5,00:00:29.000,00:00:34.000,5.0," and probably the most frequently requested culture, the Scythians."
6,00:00:34.000,00:00:39.000,5.0," That seems like quite a lot, but since there's a lot of overlap, I'll give it a shot."
7,00:00:39.000,00:00:42.000,3.0," So, welcome to another episode."
8,00:00:42.000,00:00:47.000,5.0, The Scythians are the common ancestors of the Indo-European people.
9,00:00:47.000,00:00:55.000,8.0, The word Indo-European describes a language family spoken over the greater part of Europe and Asia as far as northern India.
10,00:00:55.000,00:01:00.000,5.0," It implies that a tribe of people, the Proto-Indo-Europeans,"
11,00:01:00.000,00:01:04.000,4.0," have fused in the past from the Black Sea area or Anatolia,"
12,00:01:04.000,00:01:11.000,7.0, and identifying these people ethnically and historically will hopefully tie together many loose ends.
13,00:01:11.000,00:01:16.000,5.0," Proto just means before, original or first."
14,00:01:16.000,00:01:22.000,6.0," So Proto-Indo-European means the original tribe of people that spread in antiquity into Europe,"
15,00:01:22.000,00:01:26.000,4.0, to the west and into India to the east.
16,00:01:26.000,00:01:30.000,4.0," And when we look at the branch of anthropology known as linguistics,"
17,00:01:30.000,00:01:32.000,2.0," which means the origin of languages,"
18,00:01:32.000,00:01:37.000,5.0," the oldest branch of Indo-European languages were the Anatolian languages,"
19,00:01:37.000,00:01:40.000,3.0," the geographic area around the Black Sea,"
20,00:01:40.000,00:01:44.000,4.0," including the Caucasus Mountains, which is modern-day Turkey,"
21,00:01:44.000,00:01:49.000,5.0," and Armenia, once part of the Hittite Empire."
22,00:01:49.000,00:01:53.000,4.0, Pliny the Elder's natural history derives the name of the Caucasus
23,00:01:53.000,00:01:58.000,5.0," from the Scythian kroikasis, meaning ice shining white with snow."
24,00:01:58.000,00:02:02.000,4.0, The Caucasus is where we get the term Caucasian from.
25,00:02:02.000,00:02:08.000,6.0," In a biblical context, it's where Noah was said to have settled after the floodwaters receded."
26,00:02:08.000,00:02:13.000,5.0," In medieval ethnography, the world was divided into three large-scale groupings,"
27,00:02:13.000,00:02:17.000,4.0, corresponding to three classical continents.
28,00:02:17.000,00:02:20.000,3.0," The Caucasian Semite people of Asia,"
29,00:02:20.000,00:02:23.000,3.0," the Hamidic Caucasian people of North Africa,"
30,00:02:23.000,00:02:26.000,3.0, and the Caucasian Japhetic people of Europe.
31,00:02:26.000,00:02:31.000,5.0," While these terms are no longer in use, mainly because of changing demographics,"
32,00:02:31.000,00:02:36.000,5.0," keep in mind that they apply to millennia ago and to the nobility of these societies,"
33,00:02:36.000,00:02:41.000,5.0," not every single individual that lived within a geographical region,"
34,00:02:41.000,00:02:44.000,3.0, which at one time included large slave populations.
35,00:02:44.000,00:02:48.000,4.0," For now, let's focus on the expansion of the Scythian culture."
36,00:02:48.000,00:02:52.000,4.0, The Sumerians lived on the steppes north of the Black Sea
37,00:02:52.000,00:02:55.000,3.0," until they were driven from their homeland by the Scythians,"
38,00:02:55.000,00:03:02.000,7.0," who had themselves been driven from their homeland in Central Asia by a nomadic Masajeti,"
39,00:03:02.000,00:03:05.000,3.0," who were also part of the group known as Indo-Europeans,"
40,00:03:05.000,00:03:11.000,6.0, meaning their languages shared the same root words and part of the wider Scythian culture.
41,00:03:11.000,00:03:15.000,4.0, But these ancient Indo-European tribes were not united.
42,00:03:15.000,00:03:18.000,3.0, They were constantly at war with each other.
43,00:03:18.000,00:03:22.000,4.0," It doesn't mean that they were not of the same ethnicity, language, group, or race."
44,00:03:22.000,00:03:24.000,2.0, It just means they fought a lot.
45,00:03:24.000,00:03:28.000,4.0, So there were also cultural variations among these various sects.
46,00:03:28.000,00:03:31.000,3.0," For example, according to Herodotus,"
47,00:03:31.000,00:03:33.000,2.0," Yet all the wives are held in common,"
48,00:03:33.000,00:03:37.000,4.0, for this is a custom of the Masajeti and not the Scythians.
49,00:03:37.000,00:03:42.000,5.0, Human life does not come to its natural close with this people.
50,00:03:42.000,00:03:44.000,2.0," But when a man grows very old,"
51,00:03:44.000,00:03:49.000,5.0," all of his kin's folk collect together and offer him up in sacrifice,"
52,00:03:49.000,00:03:52.000,3.0, offering at the same time some cattle also.
53,00:03:52.000,00:03:56.000,4.0," After the sacrifice, they boil the flesh and feast on it,"
54,00:03:56.000,00:04:00.000,4.0, and those who thus end their days are reckoned the happiest.
55,00:04:00.000,00:04:03.000,3.0," If a man dies of disease, they do not eat him,"
56,00:04:03.000,00:04:05.000,2.0," and bury him in the ground,"
57,00:04:05.000,00:04:10.000,5.0, bewailing his ill fortune that he did not come to be sacrificed.
58,00:04:10.000,00:04:12.000,2.0," The only god they worship is the sun,"
59,00:04:12.000,00:04:16.000,4.0, and to him they offer the horse in sacrifice.
60,00:04:16.000,00:04:23.000,7.0," So this Indo-European sect was clearly into sun worship, cannibalism, and sacrifice."
61,00:04:23.000,00:04:28.000,5.0," Procopius of Caesarea was the principal Byzantine historian of the 6th century,"
62,00:04:28.000,00:04:30.000,2.0," and in his writings called,"
63,00:04:30.000,00:04:33.000,3.0," History of the Wars, the Buildings, and the Secret History,"
64,00:04:33.000,00:04:35.000,2.0," states that, quote,"
65,00:04:35.000,00:04:38.000,3.0," the Masajeti, whom they now call Huns."
66,00:04:38.000,00:04:43.000,5.0, Roman historians also considered the Alans to be the former Masajeti.
67,00:04:43.000,00:04:46.000,3.0," So I know this might be a little confusing,"
68,00:04:46.000,00:04:49.000,3.0," as these tribes are not spoken about in Hollywood films,"
69,00:04:49.000,00:04:51.000,2.0," or even in modern classrooms,"
70,00:04:51.000,00:04:53.000,2.0, but it will make more sense later.
71,00:04:53.000,00:04:58.000,5.0," The 4th century Roman historian, Ammianus Marcialis,"
72,00:04:58.000,00:05:03.000,5.0," wrote that the Alans were tall, blonde, and, quote,"
73,00:05:03.000,00:05:07.000,4.0, nearly all of the Alani are men of great stature and beauty.
74,00:05:07.000,00:05:11.000,4.0," Their hair is somewhat yellow, their eyes are terribly fierce."
75,00:05:11.000,00:05:14.000,3.0," According to the Jewish historian Josephus,"
76,00:05:14.000,00:05:16.000,2.0, the Alans were Scythians.
77,00:05:16.000,00:05:18.000,2.0," When we look up the Alans,"
78,00:05:18.000,00:05:24.000,6.0," we find that the name Alan is an Iranian dialectical form of Aryan,"
79,00:05:24.000,00:05:30.000,6.0, which brings us to another term no longer used in any university after World War II.
80,00:05:30.000,00:05:34.000,4.0," Yet the word Aryan is etched in stone thousands of years ago,"
81,00:05:34.000,00:05:38.000,4.0," in places like the Behistun inscription in Iran,"
82,00:05:38.000,00:05:42.000,4.0, and is synonymous with the modern term Indo-European.
83,00:05:42.000,00:05:47.000,5.0," The Alans, Masajeti, the Hittites of Anatolia,"
84,00:05:47.000,00:05:50.000,3.0," the Suebi, which I covered in a recent video,"
85,00:05:50.000,00:05:52.000,2.0," who became the modern Swedes,"
86,00:05:52.000,00:05:56.000,4.0," and occupied southern Germany in what is now called Swabia,"
87,00:05:56.000,00:06:03.000,7.0, and the Scythians were all Aryan tribes that shared Indo-European or Aryan ancestry.
88,00:06:03.000,00:06:08.000,5.0," In Histories, Herodotus describes the Boudini of Scythia"
89,00:06:08.000,00:06:11.000,3.0, as red-haired and grey-eyed.
90,00:06:11.000,00:06:13.000,2.0," In the 5th century BC,"
91,00:06:13.000,00:06:18.000,5.0, Greek physician Hippocrates argued that the Scythians were light-skinned.
92,00:06:18.000,00:06:23.000,5.0, The 2nd century BC Han Chinese envoy Zhang Qian
93,00:06:23.000,00:06:27.000,4.0," described the Saka, another name for the ethnicity known as the Scythians,"
94,00:06:27.000,00:06:30.000,3.0, as having yellow hair and blue eyes.
95,00:06:30.000,00:06:36.000,6.0," Pliny the Elder characterizes the Saka, Scythians, or Tocharians"
96,00:06:36.000,00:06:40.000,4.0," as red-haired, blue-eyed, and unusually tall,"
97,00:06:40.000,00:06:47.000,7.0," which is supported by the 4,000-year-old 6'6'' tall Caucasian mummies found in China."
98,00:06:47.000,00:06:51.000,4.0, The 4th century bishop Gregory of Nysa wrote
99,00:06:51.000,00:06:54.000,3.0, that the Scythians were fair-skinned and blonde-haired.
100,00:06:54.000,00:06:59.000,5.0," So these tall, ginger and blonde and blue-eyed Aryan tribes"
101,00:06:59.000,00:07:02.000,3.0," from Central Asia and Anatolia,"
102,00:07:02.000,00:07:05.000,3.0," which went by many names including the Huns,"
103,00:07:05.000,00:07:10.000,5.0," whose ancient symbology included the swastika symbol and serpents,"
104,00:07:10.000,00:07:12.000,2.0," entered Europe in several waves,"
105,00:07:12.000,00:07:17.000,5.0, represented as a great dragon in many European myths and legends
106,00:07:17.000,00:07:21.000,4.0," that had an appetite for cattle and young virgins,"
107,00:07:21.000,00:07:26.000,5.0, and in many cases established themselves as royalty and nobility.
108,00:07:26.000,00:07:29.000,3.0," To help drive this point home,"
109,00:07:29.000,00:07:33.000,4.0, let us take a look at some of the WWI and WWII propaganda
110,00:07:33.000,00:07:36.000,3.0, from Allied forces about the Germans.
111,00:07:36.000,00:07:43.000,7.0," Hun, or the Hun, is a term used in reference to the Huns of the migration period."
112,00:07:43.000,00:07:49.000,6.0, This term was used heavily during WWI and was often seen on Allied war posters.
113,00:07:49.000,00:07:53.000,4.0," The origin of the term was a reference to Attila the Hun,"
114,00:07:53.000,00:07:58.000,5.0," which in my last video I told you had red hair and blue or green eyes,"
115,00:07:58.000,00:08:01.000,3.0, regardless of the false modern depictions of him.
116,00:08:01.000,00:08:06.000,5.0," The usage of the term Hun to describe Germans resurfaced during WWII,"
117,00:08:06.000,00:08:09.000,3.0, although less frequently than in the previous war.
118,00:08:09.000,00:08:15.000,6.0," For example, Winston Churchill in 1941 said in a broadcast speech,"
119,00:08:15.000,00:08:16.000,1.0," quote,"
120,00:08:16.000,00:08:19.000,3.0," There are less than 70 million malignant Huns,"
121,00:08:19.000,00:08:22.000,3.0," some who are curable and others killable,"
122,00:08:22.000,00:08:27.000,5.0," most of whom are already engaged in holding down Australians, Czechs, Poles"
123,00:08:27.000,00:08:31.000,4.0, and the many other ancient races they now bully and pillage.
124,00:08:31.000,00:08:35.000,4.0," Later that year, Churchill referred to the invasion of the Soviet Union"
125,00:08:35.000,00:08:40.000,5.0," as the dull, drilled, docile, brutish masses of the Hun soldiery"
126,00:08:40.000,00:08:43.000,3.0, plodding on like a swarm of crawling locusts.
127,00:08:43.000,00:08:47.000,4.0," During this time, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt"
128,00:08:47.000,00:08:50.000,3.0," also referred to the German people in this way,"
129,00:08:50.000,00:08:54.000,4.0," saying that an Allied invasion into southern France would surely, quote,"
130,00:08:54.000,00:09:00.000,6.0, be successful and of great assistance to Eisenhower in driving the Huns from France.
131,00:09:00.000,00:09:06.000,6.0," So, I'm not making any commentary about who are the good guys and who are the bad guys."
132,00:09:06.000,00:09:09.000,3.0," Since people tend to have their minds already made up,"
133,00:09:09.000,00:09:15.000,6.0," my point is simply that blue-eyed people from the Middle East migrated into Europe,"
134,00:09:15.000,00:09:19.000,4.0, many of whom have ancestors today that have no clue
135,00:09:19.000,00:09:23.000,4.0," about their own Central Asian or Middle Eastern origins,"
136,00:09:23.000,00:09:28.000,5.0, thinking that their fair-haired and light-eyed Europeans sprouted out of the ground
137,00:09:28.000,00:09:33.000,5.0," the same way that people in modern India think that their upper caste nobility,"
138,00:09:33.000,00:09:39.000,6.0," known as Aryans, were always there and never rode in on their horses,"
139,00:09:39.000,00:09:45.000,6.0," introducing Sanskrit, the swastika and the ethnic caste system thousands of years ago,"
140,00:09:45.000,00:09:47.000,2.0, which they certainly did.
141,00:09:47.000,00:09:54.000,7.0," Geneticists, having compared mitochondrial DNA from blue-eyed individuals in diverse countries"
142,00:09:54.000,00:09:58.000,4.0," such as Jordan, Denmark and Turkey,"
143,00:09:58.000,00:10:02.000,4.0, concluded that people with blue eyes have a single common ancestor
144,00:10:02.000,00:10:06.000,4.0," that lived by the Black Sea around 8,000 years ago,"
145,00:10:06.000,00:10:08.000,2.0," spreading out from there during the Holocene,"
146,00:10:08.000,00:10:15.000,7.0," along with domesticated animals, agricultural civilization and the Aryan language family."
147,00:10:15.000,00:10:19.000,4.0," By the way, this includes many people that do not have blue eyes,"
148,00:10:19.000,00:10:23.000,4.0, but carry the gene for blue eyes recessively.
149,00:10:23.000,00:10:26.000,3.0, Live Science recently published an article titled
150,00:10:26.000,00:10:32.000,6.0," Blue-Eyed Immigrants Transformed Ancient Israel 6,500 Years Ago."
151,00:10:32.000,00:10:35.000,3.0," The article goes on to say that, quote,"
152,00:10:35.000,00:10:38.000,3.0," thousands of years ago in what is now northern Israel,"
153,00:10:38.000,00:10:41.000,3.0," waves of migrating people from the north and east,"
154,00:10:41.000,00:10:45.000,4.0," present-day Iran and Turkey, arrived in the region,"
155,00:10:45.000,00:10:52.000,7.0," and this influx of newcomers had a profound effect, transforming the emerging culture."
156,00:10:52.000,00:10:56.000,4.0," What's more, these immigrants not only brought new cultural practices,"
157,00:10:56.000,00:11:00.000,4.0," they also introduced new genes, such as the ones that produce blue eyes,"
158,00:11:00.000,00:11:06.000,6.0," that were previously unknown in that geographic area, according to a new study."
159,00:11:06.000,00:11:10.000,4.0, Archaeologists recently discovered this historic population shift
160,00:11:10.000,00:11:15.000,5.0, by analyzing DNA from skeletons preserved in an Israeli cave.
161,00:11:15.000,00:11:20.000,5.0," The site, in the north of the tiny country, contains dozens of burials"
162,00:11:20.000,00:11:27.000,7.0," and more than 600 bodies dating to approximately 6,500 years ago, the scientists reported."

165,00:11:35.000,00:11:38.000,3.0, and some of the genetic differences matched those of people
166,00:11:38.000,00:11:42.000,4.0," who lived in neighboring Anatolia and the Zagros Mountains,"
167,00:11:42.000,00:11:46.000,4.0," which are now part of Turkey and Iran, the study found."
168,00:11:46.000,00:11:52.000,6.0," So, what we have is a match between biblical stories about a tribe from the Kakaskas Mountains,"

178,00:12:32.000,00:12:38.000,6.0," so there's absolutely no discrepancy between myth and legends of tall blue-eyed Aryans,"

203,00:14:03.000,00:14:07.000,4.0, as the child of the sky god and of a daughter of the Dnieper.
204,00:14:07.000,00:14:12.000,5.0," Targutas allegedly lived a thousand years before the failed Persian invasion of Scythia,"
205,00:14:12.000,00:14:14.000,2.0, around 1500 BC.
206,00:14:14.000,00:14:16.000,2.0," He had three sons,"

213,00:15:00.760,00:15:06.519,5.759998321533203, snake-like and whose upper part was one of a hermaphrodite. The word hermaphrodite
214,00:15:06.519,00:15:12.280,5.760002136230469, is a combination of the words Hermes and Aphrodite and has occult
215,00:15:12.280,00:15:17.000,4.720001220703125, interpretations that I've covered in previous videos. The lower serpentine

221,00:15:43.040,00:15:48.000,4.959999084472656, derives from its characteristic burial tradition with red ochre. The pits were
222,00:15:48.000,00:15:53.600,5.599998474121094," called Yama. So, as you can see, this area is bordering the north of the Caucasus"

225,00:16:03.640,00:16:08.600,4.959999084472656," it's interesting that, according to Herodotus, the Scythians did not eat pork"

227,00:16:13.960,00:16:18.879,4.9199981689453125, other names that are attributed to the Scythians. The Encyclopedia Britannica
228,00:16:18.879,00:16:25.159,6.279998779296875, states the term Saka and Scyths were regarded as synonymous. Herodotus wrote
229,00:16:25.159,00:16:30.680,5.5200042724609375, that the Persians call all the Scythians Sakai. There are historians that say that
230,00:16:30.680,00:16:35.040,4.3600006103515625, the Scythians belonged to the ten lost tribes of Israel and were allied to what
231,00:16:35.040,00:16:39.960,4.9199981689453125," we call the Phoenician Empire, linking the Scythian tribes to the Hebrew"

334,00:26:03.200,00:26:08.080,4.8800048828125, The Tuatha De Danann were the Black Sea princes of Scythia. Like the original
335,00:26:08.080,00:26:12.239,4.15997314453125," dynastic pharaohs, they traced their descent from the great pen dragons of"

418,00:33:32.139,00:33:36.819,4.67999267578125," There were giants in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God"
419,00:33:36.819,00:33:42.019,5.20001220703125," came in unto the daughters of men, and they bared children to them, the same became mighty"

423,00:33:57.379,00:34:02.259,4.8800048828125, as even Jesus is said to have referred to serpents as wise.
424,00:34:02.259,00:34:08.059,5.800018310546875, The legend of King Merovi seems to conceal the true origins of the Merovingian race in
425,00:34:08.059,00:34:09.619,1.55999755859375, remote antiquity.
426,00:34:09.619,00:34:18.099,8.47998046875, Merovius derives from the French words mer meaning sea and ver meaning werewolf or dragon.
427,00:34:18.099,00:34:24.239,6.1400146484375," The book of Revelation informs us that the dragon is the devil and Satan, yet the Hebrew"
428,00:34:24.239,00:34:29.039,4.79998779296875, word Satan means an adversary or one who resists.
429,00:34:29.039,00:34:34.879,5.839996337890625," So again, what should be considered is from whose perspective is the story being told."
430,00:34:34.879,00:34:40.839,5.96002197265625," This helps to explain the esoteric allusion to the Merovingian's progenitor, King Merovi,"
431,00:34:40.839,00:34:46.439,5.600006103515625," a king of France sired by a mysterious beast of the sea, and the claim that the Merovingian"

440,00:35:18.359,00:35:23.399,5.040008544921875," In many of its documents, the Scion asserts that the new king, in accordance with the"

465,00:37:45.639,00:37:49.800,4.1600341796875, who married into the Merovingian Kings of the Franks.
466,00:37:49.800,00:37:56.000,6.20001220703125," In the book Holy Grail Across the Atlantic, author Michael Bradley says, quote, there"
467,00:37:56.000,00:38:01.639,5.63995361328125," was a very great Jewish component among the Cicumbrian Franks, Merovingians, and because"
468,00:38:01.639,00:38:06.079,4.44000244140625," they practiced polygamy, they left a great number of offspring."
469,00:38:06.079,00:38:12.319,6.239990234375, These aristocratic Merovingian children married into almost all of the noble families of Europe
470,00:38:12.319,00:38:16.279,3.96002197265625," during the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries."
471,00:38:16.279,00:38:20.800,4.52001953125, This has prompted more than one historian to suggest that the foundation of European
472,00:38:20.800,00:38:23.759,2.9599609375, nobility is Jewish.
473,00:38:23.759,00:38:28.920,5.1600341796875," According to Nicholas de Vere, author of The Dragon Legacy, members of the dragon court"
474,00:38:28.920,00:38:35.000,6.08001708984375," would often wear the insignia of a dragon curved into a circle with a red cross, the"

476,00:38:40.699,00:38:48.899,8.20001220703125," before 3000 BC, quote, it is just possible that in the Merovingians we may have a dynasty"
477,00:38:48.899,00:38:55.300,6.4000244140625," of Germanic herkenage, which means army kings or military leaders, derived from an ancient"
478,00:38:55.300,00:38:59.259,3.9599609375, kingly family of the migration period.
479,00:38:59.259,00:39:04.300,5.0400390625, The princedoms of Vere are actually cultural manifestations of genetic qualities carried
480,00:39:04.300,00:39:12.139,7.8399658203125," in the historical Elven blood royal, established in Angiers in 740 as a royal house arising"
481,00:39:12.139,00:39:19.060,6.9200439453125," from far older sacral, regal, Pictish, Scythian Vere origins rooted in antiquity."
482,00:39:19.060,00:39:24.659,5.5999755859375, The House of Vere is recorded in a single name and in an unbroken line for over 1300
483,00:39:24.659,00:39:30.339,5.67999267578125, years and consequently is one of the oldest surviving royal dynasties in Europe.
484,00:39:30.339,00:39:36.659,6.32000732421875, The House of Vere are descended in numerous lines from the Merovingian dynasty and consequently
485,00:39:36.659,00:39:40.860,4.20001220703125, share in this ancient Germanic royal blood tradition.
486,00:39:40.860,00:39:43.180,2.32000732421875, Here is Nicholas de Vere in his own words.
487,00:39:43.180,00:39:50.100,6.91998291015625," What is the significance of the dragon symbolism symbolizing, I guess, the origin of this race"
488,00:39:50.100,00:39:53.500,3.4000244140625, and the source of the power that it represents?
489,00:39:53.500,00:39:59.379,5.87994384765625, I remember you saying in your book that you can trace that back to the Sumerian figure
490,00:39:59.379,00:40:05.620,6.24005126953125," of Tiamat, the original dragon goddess who sort of represented the chaos out of which"
491,00:40:05.620,00:40:07.899,2.27996826171875, the universe was created.
492,00:40:07.899,00:40:08.899,1.0, What does it mean to you exactly?
493,00:40:08.899,00:40:09.899,1.0, The symbol of the dragon.
494,00:40:09.899,00:40:10.899,1.0, The symbol of the dragon?
495,00:40:10.899,00:40:11.899,1.0, Yes.
496,00:40:11.899,00:40:12.899,1.0, In connection to what you're doing.
497,00:40:12.899,00:40:13.899,1.0, Transcendent consciousness.
498,00:40:13.899,00:40:14.899,1.0, Okay.
499,00:40:14.899,00:40:15.899,1.0, The ability to clear the mind.
500,00:40:15.899,00:40:18.500,2.60003662109375, Let's have a look at the word dragon.
501,00:40:18.500,00:40:25.060,6.55999755859375, The word dragon comes from the Greek ἔδρακόν which is what they call an aorist or a verb
502,00:40:25.060,00:40:31.820,6.760009765625," that hasn't got a past, present or future tense, it's just a verb, of the word δεκέσθαι"
503,00:40:31.820,00:40:36.940,5.1199951171875, which is a word which simply means to see clearly.
504,00:40:36.940,00:40:41.220,4.280029296875, That means that the word dragon simply means one who sees clearly.
505,00:40:41.220,00:40:46.020,4.79998779296875," The idea of kingship or the word, let's have a look at the word king, king means to see"
506,00:40:46.020,00:40:53.620,7.5999755859375, clearly and dragon means to see clearly so therefore dragon king is a bit of a tautology
507,00:40:53.620,00:40:57.780,4.1600341796875, really because dragon and king are the same thing or dragon and prince are the first.
508,00:40:57.780,00:41:03.260,5.47998046875, The symbol of dragon for me represents firstly you have the serpentine quality of it which
509,00:41:03.260,00:41:09.820,6.55999755859375," has always been associated with healing, with the spinal column and the cerebral cortex"
510,00:41:09.820,00:41:10.820,1.0, and so on.
511,00:41:10.820,00:41:19.660,8.84002685546875," Secondly, as a serpentine figure with wings it shows that that healing power or the healing"
512,00:41:19.660,00:41:27.660,8.0, of the mind has transformed the individual who now has a higher overview of life through
513,00:41:27.660,00:41:32.500,4.8399658203125, clarity than perhaps other people do and this is why they were chosen as kings and this
514,00:41:32.500,00:41:40.700,8.20001220703125, is why through social engineering for millennia it was hoped to ensure that that clarity of
515,00:41:40.700,00:41:42.740,2.03997802734375, vision would become hereditary.
516,00:41:42.740,00:41:44.500,1.760009765625, That's what the symbol means to me.
517,00:41:44.500,00:41:48.940,4.44000244140625," The stories of your ancestors, the oldest ones, the ones that I guess could be identified"
518,00:41:48.940,00:41:53.740,4.79998779296875," with the gods of the ancient world, seems like, and I'm just generalizing a whole lot"
519,00:41:53.740,00:41:57.220,3.48004150390625, because we're talking about different figures from all sorts of different cultures throughout
520,00:41:57.220,00:42:02.060,4.8399658203125, history but in general we see the same themes in the myths surrounding these figures that
521,00:42:02.060,00:42:07.060,5.0," the original race that they came from, the original royal race, is something beyond what"
522,00:42:07.060,00:42:12.700,5.6400146484375," we consider to be human now and that they came from some sort of other world, something"
523,00:42:12.700,00:42:18.420,5.719970703125," that isn't the earth that we know today, that they had some sort of transcendent quality"
524,00:42:18.420,00:42:22.900,4.48004150390625," to them that was non-earthly and non-human, is that correct?"
525,00:42:22.900,00:42:30.660,7.760009765625," Yes, we are doing research now, Mark Pinkham and I, into the origins of the Anunnaki way"
526,00:42:30.660,00:42:38.780,8.1199951171875," back nearly 40,000 years now, 10,000 years before the hybridization of humanity to possibly"

530,00:42:53.780,00:42:54.900,1.1199951171875, so to speak.
531,00:42:54.900,00:42:59.700,4.79998779296875," The place that Shiva came to earth, which is very much like the falling to earth of"

533,00:43:08.380,00:43:16.420,8.0400390625," our people we have always been associated with Shangri-La, the Elysium Fields, Arcadia,"

535,00:43:21.780,00:43:26.780,5.0," The Principality of Wales features a red dragon, and we know the British royal family is of"
536,00:43:26.780,00:43:28.780,2.0, Germanic origins.
537,00:43:28.780,00:43:34.860,6.0799560546875," We also see the dragon on the flag of the Qing Dynasty, the first national flag of China,"

542,00:43:53.900,00:44:03.500,9.600000381469727," fortresses, and visits by the Anunnabi in the 1930s, the ancestral heritage anthropology branch of the German Nationalists,"
543,00:44:03.500,00:44:11.500,8.0," who conducted research into ancient Aryan archaeology around the world, finding archaeological evidence in places like Tibet,"
544,00:44:11.500,00:44:19.900,8.39999771118164," as well as the mummies of the Canary Islands, and ultimately linking them to a forgotten global civilization of Atlantis"
545,00:44:19.900,00:44:28.500,8.60000228881836," during the Pleistocene or Ice Age, which settled in Anatolia after a major deluge and re-established civilization there,"
546,00:44:28.500,00:44:32.500,4.0, spreading out again to other parts of the world as their nobility.
547,00:44:32.500,00:44:41.500,9.0," That said, it is these Aryan tribes that went by many names, including Scythians, that migrated into Europe in several waves,"
548,00:44:41.500,00:44:49.500,7.999996185302734," becoming the Druids, and intermarrying with the royal families and becoming sovereigns, the royal dragon bloodline."
549,00:44:49.500,00:44:56.500,7.0," The House of Dracul, or Dracula, which means dragon, and that Prince Charles claims direct lineage,"
550,00:44:56.500,00:45:02.500,6.0, descended from Attila the Hun and was established in central Europe by the sons of Genghis Khan.
551,00:45:02.500,00:45:11.500,9.0," So the Druid kings were descended from Scythian royalty and later became the Merovingian dynasty, which eventually converted to Christianity."
552,00:45:11.500,00:45:19.500,8.0," Even after their conversion to Christianity, the Merovingian rulers, like the patriarchs of the Old Testament, were polygamous,"
553,00:45:19.500,00:45:21.500,2.0, particularly with their own bloodline.
554,00:45:21.500,00:45:28.500,7.0," This ancient use of polygamy in a royal family and occult sex magic is very ancient,"
555,00:45:28.500,00:45:34.500,6.0," as the Scythian line also stretches back into ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia,"
556,00:45:34.500,00:45:39.500,5.0," as this same bloodline was not only that of the pharaohs, but also the Anunnaki,"
557,00:45:39.500,00:45:45.500,6.0," which means those of royal blood, or the serpent seed, or princely noble seed."
558,00:45:45.500,00:45:50.500,5.0," Which brings us to Robert de Bruce, who was far more than an early Scottish king,"
559,00:45:50.500,00:45:57.500,7.0," but was high-born Merovingian, priest-king of the Celtic Church, liberator of Scotland from England,"
560,00:45:57.500,00:46:04.500,7.0," sovereign grandmaster of the Order of the Knights Templar, and founder of the Order of the Rosy Cross."
561,00:46:04.500,00:46:09.500,5.0," According to Prince Michael Stewart, author of The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland,"
562,00:46:09.500,00:46:15.500,6.0," In 1307, under the auspices of Robert de Bruce and the excommunicated clergy,"
563,00:46:15.500,00:46:20.500,5.0," the Order was restructured into a church, with a hierarchy quite independent of Rome."
564,00:46:20.500,00:46:25.500,5.0," The Templar church had abbots, priests, and even bishops."
565,00:46:25.500,00:46:32.500,7.0, The knights began to train the army of Robert de Bruce in the hit-and-run tactics of warfare established in the Crusades.
566,00:46:32.500,00:46:35.500,3.0," The Roman church may have betrayed the Templars,"
567,00:46:35.500,00:46:39.500,4.0," but in Scotland they found something far more trustworthy and tangible,"
568,00:46:39.500,00:46:45.500,6.0, a sacred royal house and a priest-king of the Celtic Church succession.
569,00:46:45.500,00:46:49.500,4.0," The King of Scots was installed as a hereditary sovereign grandmaster,"
570,00:46:49.500,00:46:55.500,6.0," and from that time, whichever descending king held that office, he was to be known as Saint Germain."
571,00:46:55.500,00:47:00.500,5.0," A new order was then formed, called the Elder Brothers of the Rosy Cross,"
572,00:47:00.500,00:47:07.500,7.0, and several of the Rosy Cross knights then sailed to France for a meeting with Pope John XXII at Avignon.
573,00:47:07.500,00:47:13.500,6.0," Many historians have presumed, therefore, that the Knights Templar must have disbanded in Scotland,"
574,00:47:13.500,00:47:15.500,2.0, but this was not the case.
575,00:47:15.500,00:47:20.500,5.0, It was simply that Bruce had contrived the secret order to become even more secretive.
576,00:47:20.500,00:47:25.500,5.0," Indeed, the Order of the Knights of the Rosy Cross had been established by Bruce"
577,00:47:25.500,00:47:31.500,6.0," for Templars who had been valiant at Bannockburn, and this was a very successful cover."
578,00:47:31.500,00:47:34.500,3.0," The Merovingian dynasty still maintains its legitimacy,"
579,00:47:34.500,00:47:37.500,3.0," and according to members of the organization,"
580,00:47:37.500,00:47:45.500,8.0," will one day openly assert the divine right of the nobility to rule the world as an angelic race of demigods,"
581,00:47:45.500,00:47:49.500,4.0," whose ancestors, they claim, were the fallen angels."
582,00:47:49.500,00:47:52.500,3.0, My name is Robert Sepper. I'm an anthropologist.
583,00:47:52.500,00:47:55.500,3.0, My published work is available on Amazon.
