So tell me straight, Rabbi, have any powerful people attempted to bury this knowledge? I tried to figure out what was the disconnect in history. This video is about the Nephilim, a mystery that goes back even further than Babylon. Enjoy the ride.
        Copy



Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterwards when the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and bore children by them. These were the mighty ones of old, famous warriors of ancient times. If all the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd century, and then even the early Jewish commentators all stood on the same ground with this, why is there such a disconnect?
        Copy



I researched something interesting. There was a second council in Constantinople from the early Roman church. This was in 553 A.D. They decreed that the teachings of Origen, an early church writer on the subject of angels, could be hearsay.

This guy here was found in Peru. And here's a little baby one from Peru. Take a look at that right there. Look at the little fingers on that going up that long head. This of course is Siberia, Russia. Look at the size of the mallet on that one from Peru. He almost doesn't look friendly, does he? And this one here is from the sands of Iran. This is one of apparently about 20 from a dig site in Germany.

Would you say there's anything at all about that guy there that doesn't look, I don't know, human? This one was found in Bolivia. Hold on to your seats. We're going to go over some unique features on these long heads in just a minute. Also found in Russia, Peru. The sheer mass on the back of some of these is astounding.

Here's a child being held. Look at the size of that one in the middle. This may be the largest one in terms of head volume out of Peru. Now we're really starting to leave the it looks human range. This guy here was one of 13 found at a dig site in Mexico.

It's a biblical Hebrew text. And you start finding a lot of strange anomalies. You know, you read about giants. When Moshe Moses sent the spies over into Cana, and they described this land being filled full of giants. You know, when the spies come back, they said, you know, what were the size of grasshoppers compared to these men?
        Copy



The word Nephilim often gets translated as giants. It is true there have been actual giants in history. This is Robert Wadlow. He's the tallest man ever officially recorded in this modern time period at 8 feet 11 inches.

I actually found an ancient picture from Babylon of a giant with six fingers and toes. And the giant is actually holding a lion. And he is so large that the lion is held like I would hold a cat.

Like I'm saying to you, only if you're reading in the Hebrew are you going to see how deep this goes and how actually clear it is. It is curious where the trail can begin to lead when looking at ancient bloodlines.
        Copy



When talking about the word Nephilim, what we're dealing with is a little bit deeper and darker and larger in scope than giantism, a really tall guy, or your favorite basketball player.
        Copy



The term Nephilim became synonymous with giants because that's what they tended to be. It is by no means limited to that meaning. In fact, the word Nephilim is more of an umbrella term for the hybrid children, creatures of any high strangeness, which are actual flesh and blood, biological products of the Beneha Elohim, the fallen angels.
        Copy



Well, first, the word Nephilim is actually a plural from the Hebrew word Nephal, fallen. And when you say Nephilim, you're basically saying the fallen ones.
        Copy



Genesis chapter 6 verses 1 through 2 says that when men began to increase, the number of the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God.
        Copy



The term sons of God or the Beneha Elohim can mean angels, fallen angels, or in the book of Enoch, the watchers.
        Copy



Sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they married any of them that they chose and had children by them.
        Copy



So at this moment, without going off of any of the physical evidence and before taking a really deep look at these skulls or peering into the history and just using the texts alone, in any authentic text, whether you're dealing with actual angels or you're talking about fallen angels, these are not Hallmark card creatures.

These are extremely powerful entities. Angels often get depicted in artwork with wings. Now the Ark of the Covenant does have two cherubim depicted with wings over the mercy seat.

But, key term here, these angels are representing the cherubim at the throne of God in heaven. But I can't find one spot in the entirety of the Greek or Hebrew biblical texts where angels, dimensional beings, Beneha Elohim, stepping through into this reality had wings.
        Copy



From the angels at the tomb of Jesus Christ, no wings. All the way back to Genesis, to the angels that visited Abraham, to the angel that dropped the chains from Peter's wrists and said, Get up and come with me.

Of the Qumran fragments come from, then Enoch is telling you that a set of 200 fallen angels made physical entrance to this place. This would have been prior to the flood of Noah, as Enoch was the great-grandfather of Noah. In fact, this would have been more than a thousand years before Noah, as Methuselah, the longest living man ever recorded in the biblical text, lived 969 years.
        Copy



If you do the math on it, Methuselah actually died the very year, or seven days, before the flood. Curiously, the name Methuselah means, his death shall bring, or perhaps more precisely, his death shall bring the judgment. Speaking of strange skulls, skulls like this one here are what the archeological community often refer to as Neanderthal skulls, like this actual image of a Neanderthal skull on the screen here.
        Copy



Now there are all sorts of variations, shapes, and sizes of monkey bones on the planet earth. Monkeys and humans are grandly different in their bone structures. This is a human skeleton, and this is a set of monkey bones, like this actual bone structure of a gorilla on the screen right here. Out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of both human bones and monkey bones, such as the infamous skeletal structure of the small monkey Lucy, seen on the screen here, on the entire face of the whole planet earth, there are exactly zero mixtures of half human, half monkey, or monkeys becoming humans. Or the more commonly used terminology, there are no missing links.
        Copy



This doesn't come as terribly surprising to me, because genetically speaking, within the DNA of any living, breathing organism, animals are restricted within their animal kinds. They have certain body plans. For example, horses can breed other variations of horses within their body plans. Same thing with dogs. They can have subtypes underneath that body plan and variations, but dogs cannot breed rabbits or horses.
        Copy



Taking the genetics one step further, every living organism, its digital software coding, its actual DNA, is losing coding over time. It's weakening, deteriorating. It's not just animal species that we are systematically and slowly losing, not gaining, in the order of a thousand to ten thousand different creatures annually, depending on whose numbers that you listen to, but we're certainly losing things as opposed to gaining them. And following suit with that, the DNA, the actual digital software of life itself, for every type of creature, is also weakening with every generation. The same as would happen as if you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of anything, you're going to see it weaken, not strengthen.
        Copy



A Neanderthal skeleton and skull is absolutely identical to a modern human, except for a few key features. The bones are thicker, stronger, more fit. Also the wisdom teeth down here fit absolutely perfectly. These thick brows can vary in size from skull to skull. A small detail that a lot of people may not know, the human brow of any individual, this bone right up here, continues to grow just ever so slightly through the entirety of a person's life. You may see on an old man's brow, he's got a very defined brow.
        Copy



So if you were to live two or three or four or five hundred years, then that much larger brow that you see indenting up right there is precisely how your skull would look. When we peer back in history to our oldest written texts, we're finding redundant accounts of very long lifespans. In the biblical texts, most absolutely and definitely in the Sumerian kings list, as well as records covering what amounts to little more than settlements following the great flood as is recorded here in the Epic of Gilgamesh, along with the extended lifespans, both before and briefly after the flood.
        Copy



This is the oldest written epic in the entire world. The actual records of King Gilgamesh of Uruk, one of the first kings following the great flood. These Neanderthal skulls have varying sizes of large brows. In short, what you're looking at with these Neanderthal skulls is eerily identical to what a human being would look like if they were much more fit than we are today and had lived varying amounts of hundreds and hundreds of years.
        Copy



From a genetic perspective, no one actually knows what causes death or initiates the death process, capping us out in anywhere between 100 and 120 years. Almost as if someone flicked a switch off inside the coding. Every single cell in your entire body is programmed to regenerate and renew itself.
        Copy



But when dealing with the topic of the Nephilim, we are by no means talking about elongated years and larger brows, stronger bodies and wisdom teeth that fit perfect like a glove. The extremely long years resting on the large brow of the forehead. Nor are we fiddling around with old monkey bones.
        Copy



The truth, however, is that there are a lot of human-esque bones on this planet which can very easily, even to trained experts, blur the lines between was it human or was it something else. Now there are a lot of tribes that have done varieties of things to their bodies to achieve a number of different effects including the binding of the skull to produce this elongated shape on the back of the head.
        Copy



There are some significant differences, however, between even the best of clearly modified skulls like this skull on the screen here and skulls that appear significantly larger and much more naturally formed than that, like this actual elongated skull being compared against the bust of either Nefertiti or Akhenaten's daughter.
        Copy



Leading many to ask if these tribesmen originally began binding babies' heads in an attempt to copy something that was perhaps a whole lot larger in scope, like this actual skull found in Peru. Some of these are just absolutely massive and there are hundreds and hundreds of them, wildly massive, including children that already have the features.
        Copy



One of the first red flags that you're dealing with something that is incredibly strange is that the actual head volume of the elongated skull is at least 25% larger in its head volume than a regular human or even an old human skull. These are in fact quite different.
        Copy



But it's not just that they absolutely have to be enormously massive, there's another difference on just the skulls themselves which is even more puzzling than that. Every human skull on every single human being should have these two plates in the back of the skull that are clearly divided between the two of them by this crease running towards the back of the head.
        Copy



This elongated skull, however, is not like that with the crease and the two plates in the back. This skull has one long crease, very defined here, a crease coming back this way, and one very large skull cap. Binding a little baby's head should most certainly not change the genetic bone structure.
        Copy



But it's not just elongated heads we're talking about. We're also talking about giants like this Thailand image holding the enormous sword and the two fangs or tusks coming out of the mouth. Now I do believe that's a Babylonian Ishtar right there depicted as a circular disk which these three gentlemen are bringing before this very large character.
        Copy



Babylon, particularly ancient Babylon, plays perhaps a critical role in all this. Just second down from Babylon would be Egypt. After the Hebrews were in the wilderness during the time of the tabernacle and about to enter the promised land, in Numbers 13:33 it says this: And there we saw the giants; The Nephilim; The sons of Anak who were of the giants; And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers before them.
        Copy



Now there are some tribes where God told the Hebrews; just conquer the people; And then there are other tribes where God specified; wipe them all out; As if there's some type of a gene pool problem; As is in the case of the Canaanites; The Raphites; The Ammonites; All of which are listed as giants.
        Copy



And then you've got other types of tribes; Like for example; The Amalekites; The first part of Amalekite means people; The second part of Amalekite is an ancient word in Semitic languages that means vampire-like demon; These Amalekites were not human; And a lot of people believe that this is where the vampire legends came from in Romania; And I'm sure The Israelites well knew this by looking at them.
        Copy



I mean if The Amalekites are considered a vampire-like demon; you know; I'm sure they probably had The features; Deuteronomy 3:11 Only King Og Of Bashan The giant was left remaining Of The Raphites; The Ammonites; Or so The Hebrews believed; But The truth is giants have been reported in archaeological finds all across The globe; Particularly in The United States;

Were found around this site that has the shape of an enormous serpent that they mysteriously built, which can only truly be seen well from the air. Following the 1950s and the defeat of Nazi Germany and eugenics, same time period that Americans begin pumping out movies about space invaders and men coming from other planets and deeply religious views of the occult, such as those of Blavatsky, instrumental in the occult beliefs of Adolf Hitler himself, sort of take a sidestep into the shadows, particles such as these begin to dry up and disappear in roughly about the 1950s, and the skeletons seem to vanish. Many make the strong case that the bone structures disagree with the political formulation of the theory of evolution. Whereas that may be true, there are others who would argue that it's somewhat deeper than that.
        Copy



Speaking of occult, if I shift my attention over in the direction of ancient Egypt, the place that occasionally had kings with very unusual skulls, like this actual imagery here done using the skull of King Akhenaten. Here's the skull of the 18th Dynasty King Akhenaten without any digital effects on it. This piece of artwork is female, believed by many to be Akhenaten's daughter. Here is his son, the child king, in this x-ray on the screen here, the very infamous King Tut, who also had this rather unique family with very unusual features – long head, in all of the drawings of himself. Notice the crown is very elongated, and the strange shape of the body. And this is the wife, Nefertiti, carved in stone.
        Copy



This king moved the most powerful palace in all of Egypt to rule over an area called Amarna to take the pentacle of power and throne of the empire from Thebes and Abydos and the land of the old gods all the way up here to a newly prospering place called Amarna, which is directly across the Red Sea from Sinai. Curious thing about the ruins of this particular dig site is that it has a reported 365 outdoor altars; the practice of worship of one god – a mesmerizing place stretching into the horizon, and it's an entirely well-drawn community. All three of which are not Egyptian practices; they’re Hebrew practices.
        Copy



One thing that Akhenaten and his son, King Tut, both proved is that even god kings can die. Both were killed with remarkably similar bashes in their long heads. I personally think that the vizier Ay did it in cahoots with the head military general, Ramses, great-grandfather of Ramses the Great, but I wasn't there and the statute of limitations has run out. Akhenaten, shown here with the serpent coming out of his forehead, and his son Tut were the final kings of the 18th dynasty, later giving rise to the 19th dynasty king Ramses the Great, immortalized in this statue here, who many believe was the pharaoh at the time of the exodus.
        Copy



Merenptah, depicted here standing next to Ra with the disc encapsulated by the serpent, was the next king to take the throne of Egypt after Ramses. He was also the 13th son of Ramses the Great. Akhenaten, on his victory stele depicted right here, makes a strange statement: “The people of Israel is laid waste. Their crops are not.” I have no idea what that means. Just because your dad Ramses hands you an empire missing at least half of its army and all its slaves, you can't go getting all bent out of shape about that.
        Copy



But if I am to hop way backwards in time, that 200 fallen angels recorded as having come in prior to the flood – which is really what's being referred to when you hear terms like ‘mystery religion.’ Here's the star inside of the golden jewel-covered present. Covered in the book of Enoch, alluded to in the book of Genesis, as well as many parts of both the Old and New Testament, as well as ancient texts and hieroglyphs that we'll look at and writings all across the ancient world — being recorded in large scale prior to the flood and then in a smaller trickle of a scale following the flood.
        Copy



There are at least 277 flood stories from cultures stretching every conceivable part of the globe. Some of them bring you right to the front doorstep of that flood like the Epic of Gilgamesh from 2700 to 2900 BC. Every mountain range on earth contains fish fossils, marine life, and even seashells found on top of Mount Everest in the Himalayas. Extending to include mass-beached whale graveyards turning up in the middle of deserts like this classic example here of the mass whale graveyard in Chile —the most arid desert in the world. And here's another whale dig site from the other side of the globe in the sands of Egypt.
        Copy



Look at the size of that whale buried in that desert there. Planet and animals are found buried and fossilized in every single layer and strata of the top layers of earth. Creatures of every possible kind of animal that we see every day are found mixed in underneath earth along with mammoth-sized creatures which don't seem to be around anymore. These animals of every genre and flavor are often found in mass graveyards like this actual dinosaur graveyard seen on the screen here — as if the animals were herding and whatever happened happened fast, hit all at once, and was unexpected.
        Copy



Strangely, when dealing with strata, it is sifted by sediments exactly as one would expect if there were a lot of water pumping around on surface ground. One of enormous challenges of dating anything is knowing what pre-existing conditions were. For example, this dragonfly fossilized on screen here has a two-and-a-half-foot wingspan. Dragonflies take in perfectly the amount of oxygen they need to fly. If one were to assume atmospheric conditions — oxygen levels and carbon levels — in past were like this when they were actually way up here like this — that would indeed pump out numbers that were very large all across board.
        Copy



This dragonfly on screen could not lift up off ground and fly today. We find extremely high oxygen levels in little bitty air bubbles trapped in ancient tree sap — even buried in common things we might not think about. Look at size of this modern-day elephant compared to this giant animal here — a Brachiosaurus. Much stuff requires an entirely different and much more lush environment; this elephant is about size in girth as base of neck of this animal. Brachiosaurus would have a terribly difficult time lifting its body today — and that's but one tiny example out of an Everest-sized mountain thousands.
        Copy



The most common method of dating present day is using fossils to date geological layers and using geological layers to date fossils. Some call this circular reasoning. One thing I find fascinating; not only mass burials animals underground but mass burials trees going all sorts different directions — some interestingly enough going vertical. What this means is trees would have had to stand up for millions years while layers strata form around tree.
        Copy



No one really knows how many these actually are buried all over place underneath ground. This believed be oldest living tree on earth named Methuselah; age believed to be 4,840 years old give or take; which interesting because if you're using Septuagint or Masoretic texts even using Gilgamesh as well Sumerian Kings list reference point – you're going come up with flood date pinch more than 3000 BC maybe few hundred years more; old Methuselah would have been born just little bit afterwards. I wasn't there but know this; enormous whales really should not be turning up deserts; thousands seashells should not be backpacking through Himalayas; trees don't generally stand up tens hundreds millions years while layers sediments build around them.
        Copy



I'm thinking maybe big flood did it. Occasionally I'll hear commentators state ancient India tens tens sometimes even hundreds thousands years old; tried trace rabbit trails what they mean by that — not just India; find pulling dates out thin blue sky particularly media stuff lot; can't find what referencing. Empire India began following death Alexander Great 323 BC; begin see rise first empire India Mauryan dynasty.

        Copy





Right after the flood, they dropped down right over here, following alongside the Nile River banks, where Egypt would become, and where step pyramids and the first attempts at actual pyramids would begin to rise. Under Djoser, in the third dynasty of Egypt, about 2600 BC, the land of the Eye of Horus, and the disk between the horns of the most ancient Hathor, saw land stretches dropping down along the Fertile Land, the so-called Cradle of Civilization. This is where little bitty settlements would begin to take shape, with your first tiny fortified cities like Uruk, in roughly 2900 to 3000 BC. Coincidentally, both newly developing locations were dropping down from the same area where the boat that saved all mankind is said to have landed.
        Copy



So those 200 angels covered by Enoch prior to the flood do not represent all of the fallen angels that there are. It represents a small portion of the total number of fallen angels, the ones which made entrance to this place, came in, and interbred with human beings. This created all sorts of little uglies and unfriendlies, including the giants. There's also indications in the text that this wasn't necessarily voluntary. What some of your oldest pages and little bitty scribbles on earth, including Enoch in full detail, are telling you is that before that flood, something unfriendly made entrance to this place and was genetically breeding itself, creating its own offspring, turning mankind into a blood-bathed circus of its own unimaginable and twisted design. This virus spread generation after generation for more than a thousand years until the flood came along, wiping the slate clean and taking everything back down to zero. But then afterwards, another little bitty door opened, and perhaps what was in the past might slowly creep its way back in for a final show.
        Copy



It's my extremely strong opinion that the bulk of the hundreds of truly strange bones and enormous skulls unlike man in this video came after the ancient flood. Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward. Genesis 6:4 mentions breeding generations. Look at the scope of the size of this child's head. And then breeding even more generations. The size of the eye sockets are enormous, moving up this large skull, and then dropping down to breed some more generations. Here's another little baby one, and then breeding even more than that. Look at the eye sockets in comparison to the size of the skull atop that tiny skeleton. Enoch 7:3 mentions that when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and began to devour mankind.
        Copy



It really is absolutely astounding. It's almost impossible to believe that what you're looking at really is real. This one commonly gets called the Royal Redhead. A special thank you to Brian Forrester and his team in Paracas, Peru for making the footage, as well as the elongated skulls seen in this video available. That is one strange head. Enoch continues, saying they began to sin against the birds and the beasts and the reptiles and the fish. I have absolutely no idea exactly what that means, but it doesn't sound good. And to devour one another's flesh and drink the very blood.
        Copy



It is curious that whether in a biological or a spiritual sense, which is equally as deep if not deeper than even the mysterious thing we call consciousness—which seems in a very real way to plug us into reality at all—there's always something uniquely special about blood. There's an interesting verse we've all heard in Leviticus 17:14: "The life of all flesh is in the blood." The real word actually says "the rock of every sort of flesh that's provided," saying "the spirit of the flesh is in its blood," not "the life." That is not a poor translation but a mistranslation.
        Copy



It's important to note that after death, the blood is no longer usable as if it's lost something. Every living organism on this planet is constructed of three-dimensional digital coding—like zip files—pure data, zero junk code in every single strand. Tip for tat, line for line, it all fits together like a perfect glove. Deeper inside the genome, we find a framework of pure biological software and precision operating system with file folders containing actual body plans—digital instructions coordinating every strand, every cell, every part—pulling together molecular fabric to create a biological masterpiece. It is birthed into reality itself from scratch and seemingly plugged in neurologically and consciously to control every single system of this masterpiece.

It's not just consciousness—the intangible controlling the tangible—which is a paradox. The living blueprint for "you" is alive in every single drop of your blood. One could easily come to believe there's something much larger in scope going on here. Genesis 1:26 states that God himself created mankind in his own image and likeness—a powerful statement.

When dealing with ancient past or phenomena that boggle even trained physicians' minds, no detail should be ignored to understand Babylon and time periods lasting to this modern age—the more recent past from which these skulls likely come. One could argue that we are merely infants running around in short-term bodies—biological machines through which we peer out consciously into what we call the material world—built from thin air by digital coding far more sophisticated than all human-made computer software combined back to the very first computer.

The pages of Enoch, Hebrew texts, and various global cultures suggest something tried to plug itself in and insert itself into all this. Enoch is not just talking about dark fallen beings producing their own hybrid offspring; it goes deeper than that. He's explaining that these fallen angels produced Nephilim—neither completely angelic nor human—but something in between. They die and their souls emerge from this race of giants, giving rise to a brood of evil spirits—the foul spirits or demons on earth. When Nephilim die, they become or are added to demons—beings later cultures would call underworld gods or shadow creatures from history's ages—capable of bleeding through realms as close as air between our fingertips.

It is always eggs and semen that such entities are after or summoned. Notice the little baby down there in the image—it might not ultimately want to be friends like it’s close enough to see you. Enoch called them watchers; however, regarding darker entities—the more twisted and macabre—the better. These are not fallen angels who can go high; these are demons—Raphael—dead Nephilim.

Remember I mentioned high places with lots of red in this drawing—the more vicious and precise ceremony, intoxicated by darkness-dwelling things—that could explain it all. The well-respected ufology expert Dr. Jacques Vallee believed UFO phenomenon was demonic; human beings under control by strange forces bending them into absurd roles in deceptive games—a view shared by J. Allen Hynek.

Notably linked was Aleister Crowley—a self-proclaimed black magician affiliated with many secret societies—in providing an early-20th-century drawing of a large-headed entity he claimed stepped into physical reality—a character he described as spiritual.

Guide to him after an extensive battery of very intense black magic rituals. You may find some similarities between Crowley's drawing and thousands if not tens of thousands of other such entities drawn by people from every walk of life all around the globe. Crowley is quoted as stating, "Today they call them angels and demons, tomorrow they'll call them something else." The UFO phenomenon simply does not behave like extraterrestrial visitors. It actually molds itself in order to fit a given culture.

John Ankerberg, John Dee, the head intelligence officer under Queen Elizabeth in the 1500s, would do the deepest of interlayer occult rituals, popularizing such ideas as the crystal ball, alchemy, and the philosopher's stone. These long hours of ritual occult on behalf of the Empire of England were done with fellow black magician Edward Kelly. Kelly would ultimately leap to his death from a castle tower window. John Dee, however, would go on to catalog extensive lists, meticulously detailing out a vast array of entities, which he claimed not only could communicate but could also physically step right through into the material world itself.
        Copy



Though the public position and statement of the Empire was that Dee was communicating with angels, Dee's diary discovered following his death told a different story, recording that the entities were becoming more and more evil. Notice the serpents, stating more and more emphatically, these things are lying to me, they're not angels, they're demons. UFOanauts and the demons of past days are probably identical. Dr. Pierre Guerin, in looking at accounts of claimed aliens, all roads seem to lead to the occult. More specifically, either Egyptian or Babylonian.

Ephesians 6:12: "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, the claimed mystery religions themselves, but against principalities, powers, rulers of darkness. Whether you're talking about something that just appears in the skies, spiritual wickedness in high places," which really does beg the question, where is it when you don't see it?

One theory which can no longer be taken very seriously is that UFOs are interstellar spaceships. With Sir Arthur C. Clarke, or physically step through into this reality, your ancient texts are taking you at least ten steps further down the rabbit hole than that. I have yet to meet one person who has come out of the occult that does not have, in some cases, terrifying and extremely tangible and real accounts to give.
        Copy



I also find it particularly interesting when I've gotten to sit down with people who have had life-after-death experiences, most especially if they were legally dead for any number of minutes and have actual medical records. Hell, or ancient Sheol, whether it be from someone in the occult or someone from an after-death experience, has some strikingly eerie similarities. These bland, sort of expressionless, pull-you-in type characters, with sort of varying degrees of sinister evilness.
        Copy



Described almost like a diminished alternate version of Earth, that the person steps as if the ground level is being described as lower or different, or falls right inside of it. With things that literally grab hold and herd the people into actual pit-like cages, wherein at that point the descriptions of the creatures get even worse. Things much more disturbing and twisted than what may channel in. To be portrayed as physical artwork and representations of something through the imaginations and the minds of men.

Ephesians 2:2: "In which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world." What fascinates me is when people look up and they describe, "and the ruler of the kingdom of the air," like these Sky City type of apparatuses. It's a spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience. Sort of hover in a murky or black, dark, scarred horizon.

Whether in personal accounts or even in Enoch, you get these hints of things that are in the air and things that are moving. But diving below, where the people are quickly snatched and drugged to the side by the apparent welcoming teams. They'll talk about a lot of serpents ranging from enormous creatures to these more or less human-sized things. Often with man-like or human-like features similar to the wisdom serpents or serpent gods found in every single major ancient culture with uncanny similarities.

Look at that big old serpent crawling inside of the crescent-shaped moon between the two Babylonian Ishtar stars. I do believe you're gonna find the serpents like the one these three fine fellas are praying to in nearly every belief and religion on earth. The serpents, no matter what size or shape they're described as, just like any of the other characters within the place, always have this ancient old one, yet vicious and precise kind of highly intelligent twist.
        Copy



It's also noteworthy to point out the similarities historically of bones or warped protrusion like horns is in this recreation of Egyptian artwork. Notice the extra set of horns on top is empty whereas in this rendering between the horns you've got this little disc resting on top. An environment described at the core of its beating heart, decrepit almost with this vibe of mechanical madness combined with living dead organisms of tentacles and fangs.
        Copy



What some might have been calling the second heaven, the said diminished realm well beneath heaven and decrepit much more than earth. Littered with sophisticated type things in its skies where the fallen angel, Lucifer himself, is said to rule for a short span. Almost like hitting the show code key to the virus side of reality and cavernous needing a breath and a drop of water flames.

Probably the most terrifying part of all of it is that the things there wanted you there in their clutches for some reason. It's a prison that collects things that no one will ever come to help. I'm not going to physically or personally go in to check any of that out. I'm willing to take other people's word for it.

Was Jesus Christ who described heaven as a place full of many mansions and likened hell to this actual place here, Gehenna, outside of Jerusalem where the trash was burned? He was giving this analogy to common men, to sheep herders couched in a way that they could understand it. As if the human body itself is nothing more than a shell, a vessel, a confining temporal instrument binding one to a specific location in both time and space.
        Copy



Of those who have tried to describe heaven, though there are so many from every possible age range, background, and culture. Enoch's pre-flood account is extremely precise. People commonly talk about this unusual event called the rapture in the Bible. There are technically seven of them by my count. Enoch is the first one on that list and he is the seventh from Adam. I wonder if that has a meaning.
        Copy



He stumbles for words at least a dozen times in his document stating to you, "I wish I could describe what I'm looking at." And then afterwards talking about this place as if it doesn't even feel real anymore.

Now to understand these things called Nephilim or the origins of physical evil, it's important to recognize the entire scope. But perhaps before taking a critical look at that pre-flood world of Genesis or the kings with enormous lifespans before the worldwide flood in the Sumerian Kings list or analyzing the pages of Enoch, great-grandfather of Noah, I want you to notice the Greek Titan.
        Copy



Creatures part God, part man in this image with his arms like a crescent holding the large disk in the middle. Same as what Gilgamesh claimed he was in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest written epic on the face of planet Earth. The Titans, the sons of Saturn or sons of Satan.

This isn't just Babylon or ancient Sumeria, the place of the Anunnaki, but also biblical sons of Enoch. Kings and rulers of ages past reaching out their hands to summon the deepest regions of darkness in an effort to beckon things that bite the very hand that feeds into this place.

On top of the head of these two serpents. Here's an enormous version of the same symbol. You're going to find quite a lot of these in ancient Egypt, perhaps quite often on the head of an Egyptian goddess. And there's the little serpent. But it doesn't always have to be represented like that. For example, this golden cow's head here. See here, even the cow's got a little serpent with the two ears or horns that make sort of a cradle. Stars always representing angels inside of it with the sun shining light out from behind the ears inside of the cradle.
        Copy



But the sun also sort of looks like it makes an eye-shaped appearance going around it or a crescent moon with a star. Now, when you're talking about stars, like this large representation of a Babylonian Ishtar sitting couched inside of its crescent, the stars, when used in ancient texts, are extremely often symbolism for angels or perhaps even a very particular fallen angel. The answer goes all the way back to the Temple of Hathor, to the megacomplex of Dendera.
        Copy



Hathor goes all the way back to King Narmer himself in Dynasty Zero. That's King Narmer right there from the Narmer Pallet found in the Temple of Horus. Notice up here the long crown on the head of the king and at the top of the pallet of the first king of Egypt, the first symbol of the face of Hathor, a literal temple for storing the history all the way back to the inception of ancient Egypt itself with the symbol of Hathor crowned atop the serpent's heads. The Egyptians believed that the kingship of all Egypt started with one named Osiris, a dead man who would be brought back to life by Isis.
        Copy



Osiris would be infilled and reanimated by the spirit of an underworld god. Notice the wings on the goddess and then up over here, the little horns with the disc in the center. The flesh of the reanimated Osiris is generally a murky bluish green. This union of a resurrected dead man and a winged creature would give birth to what they called Horus. Notice the disc in this image no longer is encapsulated with horns but instead is simply wrapped with a serpent. This shape is not two horns. It's the shape of a woman's womb which is why it's on the head of a fertility goddess and the solar disc or sun disc in the center is just like the star was for the Babylonians and the sun in their hieroglyphs is owned by the serpent, the symbol for the ruler of the air.
        Copy



Inside the crescent, the birth canal or the moon being represented in the feminine in which the sun symbolically has rested inside of and producing Horus, the new little eye that is peering through and watching. Notice down here the serpent again with the little disc on its head. In fact, at the entrance to the Temple of Hathor where this enormous symbol is, there are actually 17 little bitty serpents underneath that humongous symbol. It's like a little identifier. This plus this equals this. It's like a post-it note for the ancient beast popped right on top of their heads. Move out of the way, we're making underworld gods here.
        Copy



All right, they're a bunch of demons and of course, serpents in every possible and spiritual sense. Whatever may have been the exact details of what the Egyptians were trying so dearly to express, the underworld gods are not being displayed as just basic common day-to-day knowledge on their walls but more than that, the focal point of the entire empire. It was an oppressive place. Here's a character from the walls of Egypt that you may recognize or perhaps you're more familiar with his updated version, the star in the middle of the two horns.
        Copy



We've even got two serpents down here coming out. The Goat of Mendes. This text is from the Egyptians' most treasured document, the Book of the Dead, chapter 175, where Autumn would later combine with Autumn Ra, here enlisted as the high supreme god, states this. Then I will be what will remain, just I and Asur, when I will have changed myself back into the old serpent who knew no man and saw no god.

The pain, poverty, and hardship of common people does seem to follow that star. Cambodia, you have the Naga serpent kings. In Hindu, Vishnu sleeps in the cosmos. Nirvana with the serpents. Perhaps King Solomon was right. There's nothing new under the sun. Most all ancient cultures, particularly Babylon and ancient Egypt, believed that their gods, which could be physically summoned to manifest, were in the underworld.

When you hear Luciferians and occultists throughout every age talking about the ability to summon little spookies, things that most certainly do not have your best interest at heart, or entities, very tangible things, not only does it hate you, it wishes that it could be you. It's my extremely strong opinion that they are not making that up. This was believed to be a dimension running parallel, side by side with earth, and equally as real—a place full of hate, anger, bondage, terror, total lack and despair, place where mankind is herded up and cast to the fangs of a vast array of frightening things.
        Copy



But in the very halls of pentacles of power throughout the ages of earth, men from nearly every age of empire, both great to small, in pursuit of mankind's age-old hangups—lust, greed, power—or the really big one that goes all the way back to the serpent in the garden itself: ye shall become as gods. Softly whispered lies, almost like the whole thing is a test—trinkets in exchange for everything.

Now, if we go back just a pinch before the first step pyramid in Egypt under Djoser, and I hop back over here to the land of Ur, Samaria, later Babylon, to the little tiny settlement of Uruk—called by many, the oldest city in world—and by some as the rising New York City of ancient times—is just outside ancient Uruk where Nimrod—the first king—was recorded as having been in defiance to Lord God; one great-grandson removed from Noah appeared here deified in these drawings; 4 millennium years old recreation sourced from alphanumericals found within an antiquity slab underneath historic Nineveh; among other pieces extensively documenting at Samarian sites referencing records pre-dating modern anthropocentric ideations marked as mythical legends referring to Enmerkar King; ruler seated near artifact indicating modern Babel gate invoking upon darkness shadow predecessors having bred envy amongst populous giants claiming abodes inscribed corridors reflected sinister numerations offered Siren whispers; indicative fluid re-alignment approximately symbolic Satanic light disingenuously masquerading amidst salient Celestial Angel recount necessities adhered global doctrines comparative stated MP Enters Enki abutted realm gazing organized seemingly invulnerably woven domain tagged Morning Star ties bound uniquely perceived prophecies posited Abzu derivations masked eluding mechanically envisioned Apsu waters translated Abyss encompassing endemic cryptic threshold rear annotated frequently servile aspects mass-compact chills evinced uncompromised indefinable keystone.

Behold the hand, behold the nail. Surrounded by the encampment of all of the Israelite tribes. God gave some very tedious instructions on the setup of this camp in the wilderness with the Levite priests dead in the center. In fact, itemizing out what the exact population numbers were of each of the tribes that were camping. Sometimes the most curious things are buried right in plain sight. I saved some time for you. This is what exactly that camp would have looked like.
        Copy



Does the shape of that precisely calculated layout look familiar? This image here is precisely what the shape of the Israelite camp would have looked like. Of course, the Levites and the tabernacle itself were right in the center, the heart right there. And deeper inside that middle, in the heart of the holiest of holies where the priest would stand before the mercy seat itself and say the unspeakable name of God. Behold the hand, behold the nail.

This is more than 1,500 years before Jesus Christ. It was a moving cross out there on the desert floor that would have been so mesmerizing to have seen looking down with all the little campfires going from the sky at night. Let's see if we can take that a step deeper. Curiously, if you take the names from Adam all the way down to Noah in the book of Genesis and you look at the root meaning of those names, this is what it reads. Man appointed mortal sorrow. The blessed God shall come down teaching. His death shall bring the despairing rest and comfort.
        Copy



You'd have a terrible time convincing me that some Hebrew scribes concocted that in the Genesis text. Nonetheless, let's go deeper than that. Pre-flood book of Enoch. He goes further than just fallen angels and hybrid offspring. Enoch is redundantly prophesying the coming of this Son of Man, laying out that at a time in the future not only will what has been done be undone, but further that through his name they shall be saved.

There are at least 365 extremely specific prophecies of the coming of that child and the sacrifice of a Savior. The Passover began before the final plague in Egypt before the Israelite slaves marched out of the largest empire on earth, fulfilling every single rule of a Passover sacrifice no less. And before the final plague of Egypt, they were to put the blood of the Passover lamb on their doorpost.
        Copy



Curious what meanings can be found in things when you're willing to scratch. One curious detail, the symbol of the Tav during any Canaanite or pre-Canaanite time period would have looked something like this. It is true that the ancient Tav, meaning sign or mark, perhaps covenant, looks something exactly like this. Crucifixion would not even become a practice until five ages of empires later under the Romans.
        Copy



It is interesting that the blood would be saving their firstborn sons, while God would be giving up his. In fact, even done on Passover day while the kings of earth were throwing babies onto open fire pits and flames, sparing no expense to build the grandest of towers and ziggurats to feed darkness their subjects' lives. To satisfy and appease the unending thirst of their little bitty otherworldly underworld gods.

Something tells me that in a minute here, the underworld gods and the shadow people are gonna have a role to play in all this before we get to the end. What greater love could one have than to lay down their life for their friends? Here's the empty tomb where Jesus was for three days. That 365 specific prophecies about Jesus Christ by no means includes the fabric of patterns.

There are at least four times that many for the second coming—the hours when all the old scorecards get tallied up than there are for the first. Restoration and the entrance and return of the king. But out of all of those prophecies there's only one other person other than Enoch who used this term son of man. That would have been Daniel who survived the lion's den. Well, in the very heart of Babylon no less.
        Copy



It's astounding how these things work out. It was Daniel who interpreted the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the five empires leading to the end including Nebuchadnezzar's own and not including the two before it. That makes a total of seven. I wonder if that means anything.
        Copy



But an angel would appear in the later years of Daniel's life. More specifically Gabriel, the same angel that came to Mary prior to the birth of Jesus Christ as well as believed to be an angel at the tomb after the resurrection. And not only give him a tit-for-tat sentence by sentence, line for line walkthrough of coming history and we know that none of that precision was done after the fact because the Septuagint which included Daniel was put together under Ptolemy during the third century BC as is seen in Daniel 11 beginning with the kings of the north and the kings of the south—
        Copy



The Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires predicting even the unlikely rise of the little-known underdog which would later come to be known as the Empire of Rome. Those are some really impressive guesses but by far the most impressive of the entire bunch is that Daniel would predict the exact day and date that Jesus Christ would enter the front gate of Jerusalem on the back of a donkey fulfilling Zechariah 9:9 that people rejoice as The King cometh on the back of a foul donkey.
        Copy



This would be the 10th of Nisan or more precisely April 6th 32 AD four days before the crucifixion. Daniel is giving you the exact starting point. Daniel 9:25 states “Know and understand this from: The time that the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until The Anointed One The King comes,” The date that a Persian king gave—the decree of Artaxerxes on March 14th 445 BC—to restore and rebuild Jerusalem after Persia had defeated Babylon in exactly—

Someone asked me the other day how I truly thought that the entire universe was held together. I was stumped by the question. Here's my answer. It's love. Totally undeserved love.

Oh, before I forget, Jesus did say another thing to His disciples. In Matthew 24 it says, So it was in the days of Noah, so also shall it be in the day of the return of the Son of Man.

I am the author of Thieves, One Dirty TV Pastor and the Man Who Robbed Him. This is a true story. In 1999, when I was a stupid kid, I committed a safe robbery on a television pastor named Mike Murdoch. This is an article done by D Magazine about the book. That's me down there running from Mike Murdoch with the safe on my back. This is Mike with his standard goatee up there coming through there.

To me, it all sort of feels like it happened in a different life at this point through the television screen. He looks a little bit angry in that picture there. But if you're curious what could happen to a man's mind that would drive him to commit a safe robbery on a television pastor and then end up in the desert of Mexico, you're in luck.

Here's some clips. Thieves by Trey Smith. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, anywhere books are sold. I've been on radio and TV for 20 years. And Trey, first, as far as the book itself, I'll give you an example. My producer, Will Duffy, his wife, Danielle, was in the hospital to give birth. And they had some time.

So Will is reading aloud Thieves. And not only his wife becomes addicted to it, but people in neighboring beds, neighboring rooms, all sat in to listen to Thieves being read. It's like Danielle wanted to delay labor because she was so fascinated. Thieves was me pouring literally my heart out day after day.

These were all written in a jail cell. And guards used to pay me when they were on shift, they would give me extra lunch trays to read them this book. So Thieves was originally paid for by jailhouse lunch trays.

And then after the safe robbery, when I'm on the run from a television pastor in Mexico, it really kicks into high octane. Sometimes I would just stop and say to myself, there's not a lot of really great ways for any of this to end. Crazy as it seems though; it did all well. I promise. Thank God for that.

I'm pretty certain that you're not going to find anything like this anywhere.
