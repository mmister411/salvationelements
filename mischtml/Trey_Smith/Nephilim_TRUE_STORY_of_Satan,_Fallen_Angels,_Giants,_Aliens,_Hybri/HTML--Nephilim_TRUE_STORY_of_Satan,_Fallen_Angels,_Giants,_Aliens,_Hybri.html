            <p>Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterwards when the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and bore children by them. These were the mighty ones of old, famous warriors of ancient times. If all the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd century, and then even the early Jewish commentators all stood on the same ground with this, why is there such a disconnect?

            <p>The term Nephilim became synonymous with giants because that's what they tended to be. It is by no means limited to that meaning. In fact, the word Nephilim is more of an umbrella term for the hybrid children, creatures of any high strangeness, which are actual flesh and blood, biological products of the Beneha Elohim, the fallen angels.

In fact, this would have been more than a thousand years before Noah, as Methuselah, the longest living man ever recorded in the biblical text, lived 969 years.

Out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of both human bones and monkey bones, such as the infamous skeletal structure of the small monkey Lucy, seen on the screen here, on the entire face of the whole planet earth, there are exactly zero mixtures of half human, half monkey, or monkeys becoming humans.

            <p>This doesn't come as terribly surprising to me, because genetically speaking, within the DNA of any living, breathing organism, animals are restricted within their animal kinds.

They can have subtypes underneath that body plan and variations, but dogs cannot breed rabbits or horses.

            <p>Taking the genetics one step further, every living organism, its digital software coding, its actual DNA, is losing coding over time. It's weakening, deteriorating. It's not just animal species that we are systematically and slowly losing, not gaining, in the order of a thousand to ten thousand different creatures annually, depending on whose numbers that you listen to, but we're certainly losing things as opposed to gaining them. And following suit with that, the DNA, the actual digital software of life itself, for every type of creature, is also weakening with every generation. The same as would happen as if you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of anything, you're going to see it weaken, not strengthen.

Also the wisdom teeth down here fit absolutely perfectly. These thick brows can vary in size from skull to skull. A small detail that a lot of people may not know, the human brow of any individual, this bone right up here, continues to grow just ever so slightly through the entirety of a person's life. You may see on an old man's brow, he's got a very defined brow.

When we peer back in history to our oldest written texts, we're finding redundant accounts of very long lifespans. In the biblical texts, most absolutely and definitely in the Sumerian kings list, as well as records covering what amounts to little more than settlements following the great flood as is recorded here in the Epic of Gilgamesh, along with the extended lifespans, both before and briefly after the flood.

            <p>Leading many to ask if these tribesmen originally began binding babies' heads in an attempt to copy something that was perhaps a whole lot larger in scope, like this actual skull found in Peru.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>One of the first red flags that you're dealing with something that is incredibly strange is that the actual head volume of the elongated skull is at least 25% larger in its head volume than a regular human or even an old human skull. These are in fact quite different.

            <p>But it's not just that they absolutely have to be enormously massive, there's another difference on just the skulls themselves which is even more puzzling than that. Every human skull on every single human being should have these two plates in the back of the skull that are clearly divided between the two of them by this crease running towards the back of the head.

            <p>This elongated skull, however, is not like that with the crease and the two plates in the back. This skull has one long crease, very defined here, a crease coming back this way, and one very large skull cap. Binding a little baby's head should most certainly not change the genetic bone structure.

            <p>Speaking of occult, if I shift my attention over in the direction of ancient Egypt, the place that occasionally had kings with very unusual skulls, like this actual imagery here done using the skull of King Akhenaten. Here's the skull of the 18th Dynasty King Akhenaten without any digital effects on it. This piece of artwork is female, believed by many to be Akhenaten's daughter. Here is his son, the child king, in this x-ray on the screen here, the very infamous King Tut, who also had this rather unique family with very unusual features – long head, in all of the drawings of himself. Notice the crown is very elongated, and the strange shape of the body. And this is the wife, Nefertiti, carved in stone.

            <p>This king moved the most powerful palace in all of Egypt to rule over an area called Amarna to take the pentacle of power and throne of the empire from Thebes and Abydos and the land of the old gods all the way up here to a newly prospering place called Amarna, which is directly across the Red Sea from Sinai. Curious thing about the ruins of this particular dig site is that it has a reported 365 outdoor altars; the practice of worship of one god – a mesmerizing place stretching into the horizon, and it's an entirely well-drawn community. All three of which are not Egyptian practices; they’re Hebrew practices.

            <p>One thing that Akhenaten and his son, King Tut, both proved is that even god kings can die. Both were killed with remarkably similar bashes in their long heads. I personally think that the vizier Ay did it in cahoots with the head military general, Ramses, great-grandfather of Ramses the Great, but I wasn't there and the statute of limitations has run out. Akhenaten, shown here with the serpent coming out of his forehead, and his son Tut were the final kings of the 18th dynasty, later giving rise to the 19th dynasty king Ramses the Great, immortalized in this statue here, who many believe was the pharaoh at the time of the exodus.

            <p>Merenptah, depicted here standing next to Ra with the disc encapsulated by the serpent, was the next king to take the throne of Egypt after Ramses. He was also the 13th son of Ramses the Great. Akhenaten, on his victory stele depicted right here, makes a strange statement: “The people of Israel is laid waste. Their crops are not.” I have no idea what that means. Just because your dad Ramses hands you an empire missing at least half of its army and all its slaves, you can't go getting all bent out of shape about that.

            <p>But if I am to hop way backwards in time, that 200 fallen angels recorded as having come in prior to the flood – which is really what's being referred to when you hear terms like ‘mystery religion.’ Here's the star inside of the golden jewel-covered present. Covered in the book of Enoch, alluded to in the book of Genesis, as well as many parts of both the Old and New Testament, as well as ancient texts and hieroglyphs that we'll look at and writings all across the ancient world — being recorded in large scale prior to the flood and then in a smaller trickle of a scale following the flood.

            <p>There are at least 277 flood stories from cultures stretching every conceivable part of the globe. Some of them bring you right to the front doorstep of that flood like the Epic of Gilgamesh from 2700 to 2900 BC. Every mountain range on earth contains fish fossils, marine life, and even seashells found on top of Mount Everest in the Himalayas. Extending to include mass-beached whale graveyards turning up in the middle of deserts like this classic example here of the mass whale graveyard in Chile —the most arid desert in the world. And here's another whale dig site from the other side of the globe in the sands of Egypt.

            <p>Look at the size of that whale buried in that desert there. Planet and animals are found buried and fossilized in every single layer and strata of the top layers of earth. Creatures of every possible kind of animal that we see every day are found mixed in underneath earth along with mammoth-sized creatures which don't seem to be around anymore. These animals of every genre and flavor are often found in mass graveyards like this actual dinosaur graveyard seen on the screen here — as if the animals were herding and whatever happened happened fast, hit all at once, and was unexpected.

            <p>Strangely, when dealing with strata, it is sifted by sediments exactly as one would expect if there were a lot of water pumping around on surface ground. One of enormous challenges of dating anything is knowing what pre-existing conditions were. For example, this dragonfly fossilized on screen here has a two-and-a-half-foot wingspan. Dragonflies take in perfectly the amount of oxygen they need to fly. If one were to assume atmospheric conditions — oxygen levels and carbon levels — in past were like this when they were actually way up here like this — that would indeed pump out numbers that were very large all across board.

We find extremely high oxygen levels in little bitty air bubbles trapped in ancient tree sap — even buried in common things we might not think about. Look at size of this modern-day elephant compared to this giant animal here — a Brachiosaurus. Much stuff requires an entirely different and much more lush environment; this elephant is about size in girth as base of neck of this animal. Brachiosaurus would have a terribly difficult time lifting its body today — and that's but one tiny example out of an Everest-sized mountain thousands.

One thing I find fascinating; not only mass burials animals underground but mass burials trees going all sorts different directions — some interestingly enough going vertical. What this means is trees would have had to stand up for millions years while layers strata form around tree.

Under Djoser, in the third dynasty of Egypt, about 2600 BC, the land of the Eye of Horus, and the disk between the horns of the most ancient Hathor, saw land stretches dropping down along the Fertile Land, the so-called Cradle of Civilization. This is where little bitty settlements would begin to take shape, with your first tiny fortified cities like Uruk, in roughly 2900 to 3000 BC. Coincidentally, both newly developing locations were dropping down from the same area where the boat that saved all mankind is said to have landed.

            <p>So those 200 angels covered by Enoch prior to the flood do not represent all of the fallen angels that there are. It represents a small portion of the total number of fallen angels, the ones which made entrance to this place, came in, and interbred with human beings. This created all sorts of little uglies and unfriendlies, including the giants. There's also indications in the text that this wasn't necessarily voluntary. What some of your oldest pages and little bitty scribbles on earth, including Enoch in full detail, are telling you is that before that flood, something unfriendly made entrance to this place and was genetically breeding itself, creating its own offspring, turning mankind into a blood-bathed circus of its own unimaginable and twisted design. This virus spread generation after generation for more than a thousand years until the flood came along, wiping the slate clean and taking everything back down to zero. But then afterwards, another little bitty door opened, and perhaps what was in the past might slowly creep its way back in for a final show.

            <p>It's my extremely strong opinion that the bulk of the hundreds of truly strange bones and enormous skulls unlike man in this video came after the ancient flood. Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward. Genesis 6:4 mentions breeding generations. Look at the scope of the size of this child's head. And then breeding even more generations. The size of the eye sockets are enormous, moving up this large skull, and then dropping down to breed some more generations. Here's another little baby one, and then breeding even more than that. Look at the eye sockets in comparison to the size of the skull atop that tiny skeleton. Enoch 7:3 mentions that when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and began to devour mankind.

A special thank you to Brian Forrester and his team in Paracas, Peru for making the footage, as well as the elongated skulls seen in this video available. That is one strange head. Enoch continues, saying they began to sin against the birds and the beasts and the reptiles and the fish. I have absolutely no idea exactly what that means, but it doesn't sound good.

            <p>It is curious that whether in a biological or a spiritual sense, which is equally as deep if not deeper than even the mysterious thing we call consciousness—which seems in a very real way to plug us into reality at all—there's always something uniquely special about blood. There's an interesting verse we've all heard in Leviticus 17:14: "The life of all flesh is in the blood." The real word actually says "the rock of every sort of flesh that's provided," saying "the spirit of the flesh is in its blood," not "the life." That is not a poor translation but a mistranslation.

            <p>It's important to note that after death, the blood is no longer usable as if it's lost something. Every living organism on this planet is constructed of three-dimensional digital coding—like zip files—pure data, zero junk code in every single strand. Tip for tat, line for line, it all fits together like a perfect glove. Deeper inside the genome, we find a framework of pure biological software and precision operating system with file folders containing actual body plans—digital instructions coordinating every strand, every cell, every part—pulling together molecular fabric to create a biological masterpiece. It is birthed into reality itself from scratch and seemingly plugged in neurologically and consciously to control every single system of this masterpiece.

Enoch is not just talking about dark fallen beings producing their own hybrid offspring; it goes deeper than that. He's explaining that these fallen angels produced Nephilim—neither completely angelic nor human—but something in between. They die and their souls emerge from this race of giants, giving rise to a brood of evil spirits—the foul spirits or demons on earth. When Nephilim die, they become or are added to demons—beings later cultures would call underworld gods or shadow creatures from history's ages—capable of bleeding through realms as close as air between our fingertips.

These long hours of ritual occult on behalf of the Empire of England were done with fellow black magician Edward Kelly. Kelly would ultimately leap to his death from a castle tower window. John Dee, however, would go on to catalog extensive lists, meticulously detailing out a vast array of entities, which he claimed not only could communicate but could also physically step right through into the material world itself.

I do believe you're gonna find the serpents like the one these three fine fellas are praying to in nearly every belief and religion on earth. The serpents, no matter what size or shape they're described as, just like any of the other characters within the place, always have this ancient old one, yet vicious and precise kind of highly intelligent twist.

He was giving this analogy to common men, to sheep herders couched in a way that they could understand it. As if the human body itself is nothing more than a shell, a vessel, a confining temporal instrument binding one to a specific location in both time and space.

            <p>On top of the head of these two serpents. Here's an enormous version of the same symbol. You're going to find quite a lot of these in ancient Egypt, perhaps quite often on the head of an Egyptian goddess. And there's the little serpent. But it doesn't always have to be represented like that. For example, this golden cow's head here. See here, even the cow's got a little serpent with the two ears or horns that make sort of a cradle. Stars always representing angels inside of it with the sun shining light out from behind the ears inside of the cradle.

Now, when you're talking about stars, like this large representation of a Babylonian Ishtar sitting couched inside of its crescent, the stars, when used in ancient texts, are extremely often symbolism for angels or perhaps even a very particular fallen angel. The answer goes all the way back to the Temple of Hathor, to the megacomplex of Dendera.

Notice up here the long crown on the head of the king and at the top of the pallet of the first king of Egypt, the first symbol of the face of Hathor, a literal temple for storing the history all the way back to the inception of ancient Egypt itself with the symbol of Hathor crowned atop the serpent's heads. The Egyptians believed that the kingship of all Egypt started with one named Osiris, a dead man who would be brought back to life by Isis.

The flesh of the reanimated Osiris is generally a murky bluish green. This union of a resurrected dead man and a winged creature would give birth to what they called Horus. Notice the disc in this image no longer is encapsulated with horns but instead is simply wrapped with a serpent. This shape is not two horns. It's the shape of a woman's womb which is why it's on the head of a fertility goddess and the solar disc or sun disc in the center is just like the star was for the Babylonians and the sun in their hieroglyphs is owned by the serpent, the symbol for the ruler of the air.

In fact, at the entrance to the Temple of Hathor where this enormous symbol is, there are actually 17 little bitty serpents underneath that humongous symbol. It's like a little identifier.

It was an oppressive place. Here's a character from the walls of Egypt that you may recognize or perhaps you're more familiar with his updated version, the star in the middle of the two horns.

            <p>There are at least four times that many for the second coming—the hours when all the old scorecards get tallied up than there are for the first. Restoration and the entrance and return of the king. But out of all of those prophecies there's only one other person other than Enoch who used this term son of man. That would have been Daniel who survived the lion's den. Well, in the very heart of Babylon no less.

            <p>It's astounding how these things work out. It was Daniel who interpreted the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the five empires leading to the end including Nebuchadnezzar's own and not including the two before it. That makes a total of seven. I wonder if that means anything.

            <p>But an angel would appear in the later years of Daniel's life. More specifically Gabriel, the same angel that came to Mary prior to the birth of Jesus Christ as well as believed to be an angel at the tomb after the resurrection. And not only give him a tit-for-tat sentence by sentence, line for line walkthrough of coming history and we know that none of that precision was done after the fact because the Septuagint which included Daniel was put together under Ptolemy during the third century BC as is seen in Daniel 11 beginning with the kings of the north and the kings of the south—

            <p>The Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires predicting even the unlikely rise of the little-known underdog which would later come to be known as the Empire of Rome. Those are some really impressive guesses but by far the most impressive of the entire bunch is that Daniel would predict the exact day and date that Jesus Christ would enter the front gate of Jerusalem on the back of a donkey fulfilling Zechariah 9:9 that people rejoice as The King cometh on the back of a foul donkey.

Never listen to snakes because they're snakes. You were born to be free in every possible sense in both this life and the next. It's my extremely strong opinion that the shadow people are not your friends. Go on your own journey to ask these very same questions. Your life is worth that.

            <p>I am the author of Thieves, One Dirty TV Pastor and the Man Who Robbed Him. This is a true story. In 1999, when I was a stupid kid, I committed a safe robbery on a television pastor named Mike Murdoch. This is an article done by D Magazine about the book. That's me down there running from Mike Murdoch with the safe on my back. This is Mike with his standard goatee up there coming through there.

But if you're curious what could happen to a man's mind that would drive him to commit a safe robbery on a television pastor and then end up in the desert of Mexico, you're in luck.

            <p>Here's some clips. Thieves by Trey Smith. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, anywhere books are sold. I've been on radio and TV for 20 years. And Trey, first, as far as the book itself, I'll give you an example. My producer, Will Duffy, his wife, Danielle, was in the hospital to give birth. And they had some time.

            <p>So Will is reading aloud Thieves. And not only his wife becomes addicted to it, but people in neighboring beds, neighboring rooms, all sat in to listen to Thieves being read. It's like Danielle wanted to delay labor because she was so fascinated. Thieves was me pouring literally my heart out day after day.

            <p>These were all written in a jail cell. And guards used to pay me when they were on shift, they would give me extra lunch trays to read them this book. So Thieves was originally paid for by jailhouse lunch trays.

            <p>And then after the safe robbery, when I'm on the run from a television pastor in Mexico, it really kicks into high octane. Sometimes I would just stop and say to myself, there's not a lot of really great ways for any of this to end. Crazy as it seems though; it did all well. I promise. Thank God for that.
