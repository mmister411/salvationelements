            <p>I can tell you that the occult people all believe stuff can step right out of thin air. That's what they write in all the documents. I mean, no good occultist doesn't believe... I mean, you're not a very good occultist. You can't get that to happen, I guess. I wouldn't be impressed with you.

            <p>And since so much deals with the occult, it's important to understand the history behind some of the occult. Jesus said to be wise as serpents, but gentle as doves. So when we look at the occult, we probably ought to start in at some of the basic elements of it in your modern age. And the hero of modern occultism, or one of them, would be, of course, Aleister Crowley, seen here with the eye on top of his head, the pyramid eye on top of his head. And that symbol right there, it's only really appropriate that that symbol begin to take its rise again as you lead towards the end.

            <p>That symbol is the 70. Images of that rotating thing captured by U.S. Navy aircraft, sensors locking in on the target. Commander David Fravor saw it firsthand during a training mission, describing it like a 40-foot-long tic-tac. This entity called Lamb, he claimed would physically manifest in the midst of some of these rituals. It is also believed to be the first drawing in modern history of what today is called a gray alien. That's kind of interesting, isn't it?

            <p>This is a story that starts with a snake. This show has closely followed the possibility there could be unknown entities in the skies above us. I believe that, but could they be even closer than that, right here? A new Wall Street Journal report profiles the many parents who think they can see ghosts, specters, and mysterious movements on their advanced baby monitors. Well, the UFO phenomenon, it was always there.

            <p>Oh, man, it's breaking our physics. Maneuvering rapidly and changing direction. And as we both looked out the right side of our airplane, we saw a disturbance in the water and a white object, oblong, pointing north. The object was first sighted in 2004, then similar objects again in 2015. But, I mean, the objects were always, I mean, the whole UFO phenomenon would just appear and then disappear. So the question becomes, where's it when you don't see it? And there's so many of them, man. People catch these on their cell phones everywhere.

            <p>Black magician Elias Levy—that's him up here—is depicted pictured above using a grimoire. That's a book of ritual magic. He has opened a portal to the dark world right there to summon an ancient wisdom demon called a Yoda. So that's what stepped through.

            <p>So the circle he's got under him with the pentagrams and all of this—he's created another pentagram over there where he will summon the Yoda that will come through. I don't know how in the Star Wars films you could ever copyright the Yoda because I see Yoda dolls everywhere and I'm assuming that Star Wars believes it owns those.
