00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.600
 If you were looking for some kind of an ordinary science video, this is not that video.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.899
 Everything from God to heaven to hell to time to space, when you hear the science guys talking

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:27.719
 about the theory of everything, we're not talking about the same thing.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:36.279
 To dimensions and all that which lies between, from the cells to the stars to the quantum

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:44.000
 particles making up the whole, oh yes, we're going a lot deeper on this one.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.360
 From angels to fallen angels to demons to devils to even the claimed dragons of ages

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.439
 past, to mankind's origin itself.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.240
 Buckle your seatbelts.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.200
 Welcome to the theory of everything.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 Now to really dig into this, you've got to start with the understanding that it's not

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960
 just the universe.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.840
 It's like this enormous Swiss watch.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 The living organisms in this place are literally made of digital codes, of mechanics that we

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.719
 really don't understand even the tip of the iceberg of.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:40.880
 These are actual zip files, DNA strands to basically open like hyper-intensified life

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.599
 running all over the place to create every single life form on this planet.

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:49.599
 It's bigger than that.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.519
 Let me put this in perspective for you.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:59.080
 Everything from the fish and the plankton in the sea to the air that you breathe in,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.560
 the oxygen from the trees to the carbon dioxide that you feed them back and return to the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.000
 land animals that crawl on the ground.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.640
 You and I right now while you're watching this video on the other side of the screen

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:25.200
 are on a little bitty blue rock that it's all also symbiotic in an enormous black abyss

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.840
 called space.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.720
 Everything here is connected to everything else almost like a cradle that's for the infants.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.239
 This is not just a few things work together here and there.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:49.119
 This is sheer precision in every little piece of every part of this place.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.879
 Systems built on systems built on systems.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:03.319
 Genesis means the point of origin, the beginning, the inception, where what was not becomes

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.319
 what is.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.519
 It even has its own little force field ozone to keep the atmosphere in.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.559
 All making a whole.

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:18.839
 It is all connected from the cells to the stars.

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:20.439
 Isn't that awesome?

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.319
 Look how thin that is beyond imagination.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.359
 They're sure glad that thing's there.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.679
 The three greatest mysteries since the very beginning of science have been time, space

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:34.679
 and matter.

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:39.759
 The origin of one should explain the origin of all three.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:44.119
 The Rubik's Cube puzzle of science.

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.159
 The Holy Grail.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.919
 Let's take a crack at it right at the start of this video.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:57.440
 The material world is comprised of the very fabric of the material world made of an atomic

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440
 world.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.720
 All of it from the air that you breathe to the earth that you're standing on to the planets.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.039
 The illusion of reality and the stars above are all made of an atomic world.

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:16.239
 Beginning in the 1920s, the era of Einstein, Max Planck and these other guys, they ran

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.440
 into a serious problem.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.399
 You dive right beneath that, which is comprised of a subatomic world, a subatomic matrix.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:32.399
 And you're in your subatomic world, the place where the numbers go absolutely haywire.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:39.959
 When they tried to pinpoint the exact location of subatomic particles, they found that it

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.879
 was utterly impossible.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:48.639
 It's in fact at that point that you run into the scary measurement problem that we're going

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.639
 to talk about.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.199
 Then you would think, if you dug all the way down to the center, that little nucleus guy

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.639
 right there that's floating loose, maybe he would be solid.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.759
 Nope, same thing.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:07.239
 Little dots all poking around so fast and boom, the spot where the paradox began.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:13.959
 Statistical probabilities to make the illusion of the material world.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:18.220
 So let's recap this thing, just to get a grip on what we're dealing with here.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.799
 The quantum worlds are literally the framework of this entire place, the thing that we call

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:28.440
 reality itself.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:36.119
 The foundation that actually makes up every single science of this place.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:45.039
 So we're in an enormous black abyss of space on a little blue rock of hyper-intensified

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.599
 life and order.

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:52.919
 In the ancient book of Hebrews, it actually states a very fascinating thing.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.119
 In the 11th chapter, the 3rd verse, it says,

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:06.879
 For we know by faith that it was with words of God that the worlds were formed, that what

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:13.039
 is seen is made from that which is unseen.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.440
 Another translation of words is vibrations.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:26.879
 As men speak words of sound that go a matter of feet and last only a couple of seconds.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:32.319
 Perhaps God himself speaks substance.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.319
 So is reality totally internalized into the little bitty universe that we live in?

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:46.159
 Or is the scope of things a little bit larger than that?

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:53.019
 Wasn't it Albert Einstein who said, those of us that believe in physics understand that

00:06:53.019 --> 00:07:01.299
 reality is nothing more than a stubbornly persistent illusion?

00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:09.099
 If that's true, then one might ask, where's the illusion coming from?

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:17.099
 To answer that question, I'd like to begin by taking a look at this little blue rock.

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:23.219
 The current conjectures in most all of science, the most predominant ones at this point, is

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.579
 that the entire place, including the universe right down to the earth, right down to the

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:32.619
 cells in your skin, the DNA strands and even the fabric in those quantum worlds is all

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.579
 a product of sheer absolute randomness.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:40.539
 I'd like to take a peek at that.

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:47.459
 So if you and I are the amazingly intelligent fish within an enormous fishbowl, I guess

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:53.819
 my first couple of questions would be, how did the fishbowl get there and how did we

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:56.059
 get inside of it?

00:07:56.059 --> 00:08:02.099
 In mathematics, anything that is 10 to the 50th power to 1 is considered impossible.

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:04.659
 It would be an absolute miracle.

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:11.259
 Just to give you a train of reference for that, 10 to the 82nd power is how many atoms

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:13.139
 are believed to be in the entire universe.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:22.579
 Now it was Roger Penrose that came up with this number here for the odds of a universe

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:27.939
 that would produce one planet that could sustain life like the earth.

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:33.639
 So if that didn't bother you the first time, let me run it by you one more time again.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:36.279
 Another impossibility, another impossibility, another impossibility.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.719
 So let me tell you what this means.

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:45.039
 Right now, while you're watching this video, by any mathematical construct, possibility,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:50.999
 another impossibility, another impossibility, another impossibility, you and I are sandwiched

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:57.919
 right dead in the center of a place that should not exist.

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.959
 And that's just where we start.

00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:08.899
 And everything in the universe works together as a perfect precision of order to allow the

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:11.419
 existence of this little blue rock.

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:20.919
 And everything on this little blue rock are symbiotic relationships to allow us to exist.

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:23.439
 Everything here is symbiotic.

00:09:23.439 --> 00:09:28.719
 It is all systems that are intimately dependent on other systems.

00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:35.739
 So this is a protein manufacturing line within inside the cell.

00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:43.719
 Like sometimes the key to exactly what you've been looking for is right in front of you.

00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:48.199
 If you take a second to look at it.

00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:51.919
 This is not just a few examples here and there.

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:58.719
 Basically everything in this place is connected, no matter how loosely, to every other thing

00:09:58.719 --> 00:09:59.719
 in this place.

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:05.999
 From the food chains, and the underwater worlds, the land animals that roam on the ground,

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:12.559
 to the very cells and the skin and the fabric of this entire place.

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:18.439
 To get a DNA strand, you have to have the proteins configured properly.

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:23.160
 But to get the proteins, you've got to have the DNA strand.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.840
 There is no chicken before the egg.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.079
 And that's just one example of this.

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:35.239
 Many would argue that the entire place, the construct of the universe, right down to the

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:42.879
 earth, to the molecular fabric of your skin, is irreducibly complex from bottom to top.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:49.079
 So entropy, one of the laws of thermodynamics, is that things deteriorate.

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:51.840
 They decline over time.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.259
 It's not really complex.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:11:01.759
 We observe this on a day-to-day basis that organized things tend to deteriorate to chaos

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:03.439
 over time.

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:04.840
 They don't seem to improve.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:11.679
 Now with humans, we engineer stuff and we try and tug-of-war and fight with entropy

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:17.639
 and build better things, but ultimately, systems decline.

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:23.759
 Our construct, our physical bodies, are made not only just of the particles, which we'll

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:31.279
 touch on and get into in just a second, but those particles, those little precision units

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:37.999
 of information, which is what Einstein would have called them, those little digits are

00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:43.239
 making up the cells, which are as complex as cities.

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:50.199
 We're going to carry it to the nucleus of the cell, which is going to open up and let

00:11:50.199 --> 00:11:58.359
 the RNA carry this DNA, RNA delivery system into the heart of the cell.

00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:05.679
 Have you ever noticed that sometimes to understand the larger scope of something, you've got

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:08.959
 to actually go surgical for a minute.

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:12.359
 Get your hands right in the mix.

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:16.759
 Pay attention to its smallest parts for just a minute.

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:23.679
 Here, imagine winning the lottery every single day, not missing once.

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:30.599
 For the next 10,000 years, you would still be nowhere close to that number.

00:12:30.599 --> 00:12:42.799
 The odds of one single cell, just one little cell guy, are 10 to the 39,970 to 1, give or take.

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:48.279
 Now in comparison to that last number, this one looks really small, right?

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:55.119
 And in mathematics, we know that anything that is 10 to the 50th power to 1 is a mathematical

00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:56.119
 impossibility.

00:12:56.119 --> 00:13:02.999
 There are 10 to the 82nd power atoms believed to be in the entire universe.

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:08.639
 So how many times does this number fit into that number above?

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:15.479
 The answer is this, trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions, and this number

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:21.559
 could keep on going for a long, long ways.

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:32.039
 There's the number of atoms in the universe to 1 against there being one single cell in

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:33.039
 this place.

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:36.919
 I went with the low ball numbers on that, by the way.

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:45.199
 Now the inside of a cell is a living, breathing, high performance, no nonsense, no joke factory.

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:52.039
 There's my DNA strand inside the heart of the cell, and these little machine guys come

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:56.319
 through here in a process called transcription.

00:13:56.319 --> 00:13:59.119
 These things are the size of cities.

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:06.159
 In fact, the inner world of this cell is larger in its inner world than New York City with

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:12.199
 all of its little parts doing very specific precision jobs.

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:16.079
 Then this next set of machines come through, and they're writing, and they're actually

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:22.479
 doing copying, which, of course, like any factory, it all fits together like a perfect

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:23.479
 glove.

00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:27.159
 It doesn't have spare factory parts in there.

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:34.759
 Every little piece is serving a precision role to every other part within the inside

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:39.199
 of that cell, which would mean, of course, that at its inception, it has...

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:43.839
 to starve as a complete piece, otherwise it wouldn't exist at all.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:51.839
 In fact, if you took every piece of technology that we have ever made, packed it into a space

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:58.919
 so small that you could barely see it with our largest microscopes, you would still be

00:14:58.919 --> 00:15:08.199
 light years away from the technology employed in a single cell of this place.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:13.319
 And that single cell guy, he's dependent on other things that are beating the exact

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:16.719
 same odds, or actually larger odds, as well.

00:15:16.719 --> 00:15:21.839
 See, he's dependent on things, and those things are dependent on things.

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:27.279
 Single cell is not just dependent on all of its internal parts, but it's dependent on

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.959
 the external world as well.

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:38.839
 Other things beating the same type of numbers, as if simultaneously, so that all of the parts

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:44.999
 can function, accident after accident after accident after accident, and those things

00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:49.159
 are dependent on things, and those things dependent on things, and those things things

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:56.079
 of things of things, until you realize that all of it is dependent on all of it, beating

00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:59.959
 odds just like these, for them to exist at all.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.399
 Let me put this in perspective for you.

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:10.959
 Imagine you were that single cell, and you had just beat absolute mathematical insanity,

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:13.679
 and here you come into existence.

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:20.519
 But immediately you die, because all of the other stuff that you're dependent on, it's

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.879
 not in place.

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:28.039
 Just like the accidents were, I don't know, coordinated?

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:36.759
 Every living biological organism on this planet is constructed of little bitty factories.

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:46.919
 These precision factories are all doing sophisticated operations within the entirety of the cell.

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:53.359
 Each of those factories has tons and tons of parts that are all working together, doing

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:59.839
 these little precision jobs, but they're not doing these jobs on their own.

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:05.279
 These factories need sets of instructions, they need software.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:10.559
 All of the parts of the cell are not randomly doing jobs.

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:17.319
 They're doing it based on digital coding, which is giving instructions to all of the

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.759
 machines.

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:24.999
 So the machines not only have to be designed to work with the software, but the software

00:17:24.999 --> 00:17:30.099
 has to be designed to give instructions to the machines.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:35.159
 So when you hear the scientists marveling, saying, how can this happen on its own?

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:37.239
 Why are the numbers this bad?

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:45.399
 The mathematical miracles happening all over the place, that's why the numbers are that

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:46.399
 bad.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:58.159
 At some point on the timeline, order does have to occur, because we're here, right?

00:17:58.159 --> 00:18:05.359
 Then it's about to get more intense, because the digital coding in your cellular factories

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:09.719
 is about to have to coordinate and come together.

00:18:09.719 --> 00:18:17.359
 That gets you one single cell in all of the factory parts that are moving inside that

00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:24.719
 cell and the little digital DNA software running the cell guy on top of the earth that shouldn't

00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:29.079
 be there, in the universe that came out of nowhere.

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:36.279
 But this, right here, is the point where the accidents have to go sheer precision.

00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:39.439
 That's a human heart right there, surgical.

00:18:39.439 --> 00:18:44.559
 These accidents have got to be shoved violently into hyperdrive.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:47.479
 Millions and millions and millions and millions.

00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:51.799
 That is a very sophisticated piece of machinery.

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:58.759
 You do not want the digital instructions that are all coming together to create that guy.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:03.119
 You cannot have trial and error, a little bit off this way, a little bit off that way

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:06.999
 would be a bad, bad thing.

00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:15.519
 Have got to come together and coordinate of digital code all funneled into a pure live

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:16.519
 feed.

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:26.239
 Now all of the digital mastery has got to come together as one complete, creating everything

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:32.239
 from the bones being written in, to the muscles, to the ear, is where the rabbit hole goes

00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:33.919
 really deep.

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:37.719
 The part where you need the master file.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:45.599
 You need body plans which will coordinate all of that software to become that pulls

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:51.679
 all of it together into one majesty, a body plan.

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:57.439
 Putting together everything from the fingertips to the tongue to the toes and every part in

00:19:57.439 --> 00:20:05.559
 between and mind you, you need a body plan not just for the human beings but a separate

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:17.799
 set of living instructions for every living breathing species type and kind of organism

00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:19.799
 on this planet.

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:25.479
 And this digital code has got to be a lot more complex than any of our stuff.

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:33.079
 It has to be three dimensional and configured properly because it's making three dimensional

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:37.519
 biological organisms from scratch.

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:45.879
 Not only are there no spare parts, not just on human beings but on any other species of

00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:48.479
 creature on earth.

00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:51.719
 They're all a precision completeness.

00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:58.399
 But more than that, unlike machines that we make like computers and things of that type,

00:20:58.399 --> 00:21:03.839
 it can do redundant error correction to make sure that this comes out right.

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:10.519
 And unlike clunky machines made by man, it can self-heal like cranes and such that with

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:16.399
 time the part will wear out in the construct of the human condition.

00:21:16.399 --> 00:21:21.519
 The muscles are actually designed to strengthen with use.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:26.719
 A literal mastery of biological hardware.

00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:31.959
 But it's not complete until, boom, you got your consciousness.

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:34.039
 Never forget the cherry on top.

00:21:34.039 --> 00:21:36.319
 Right on top of all of it.

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:39.319
 Sort of like being plugged into wifi, huh?

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:44.959
 The real you and neurons and little connections coming down the spinal cord.

00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:50.319
 It's almost like there's something larger going on here than mortgage payments and car

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:51.319
 notes.

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:53.239
 Look, here's the paradox.

00:21:53.239 --> 00:21:54.959
 Let me lay it out for you.

00:21:54.959 --> 00:22:00.639
 You can see the hyper-intensified order all inside.

00:22:00.639 --> 00:22:04.759
 Every little detail of the place.

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:11.759
 But you cannot see the source from which that order comes.

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:16.839
 Even if it's dimensionally layered right on top of it.

00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:18.719
 We'll get to that.

00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:25.279
 The very spot within the life sciences where the matrix of all the little bitty fabric

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:31.919
 of machines and cells and parts that have come together to make the beautiful construction

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:40.799
 of these biological machines within the matrix of this place gets smack dab hit with the

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.279
 neurosciences.

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:51.279
 There is no point within those two sciences alone where you're going to run into the metaphysical,

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:58.759
 the dimensional, and the spiritual faster than that point to give all of these precise

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:03.879
 directions to the parts right at the moments that you think about them.

00:23:03.879 --> 00:23:07.039
 Some kind of a point of translation.

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:12.439
 There's got to be a little bit more going on in there than just little electrical connections.

00:23:12.439 --> 00:23:20.359
 In both the Greek and Hebrew texts it refers to the human body as a temple that are zipping

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:22.159
 this way and that.

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:25.799
 Not in any random fashion, mind you.

00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:34.039
 The ghost in the machine, the actual intangible conscious being that makes up what you call

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:41.399
 you operating through a physical apparatus of the human body.

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:45.159
 The intangible controlling the tangible.

00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:51.759
 The very spot where some might argue two dimensions meet.

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:59.039
 Right here in Genesis 127 it does say that God created man in his own image.

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:01.959
 It's a bold statement.

00:24:01.959 --> 00:24:12.639
 97% of your entire body is all self-functioning from the organs to the cells to every single

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:16.959
 part of your biological machinery.

00:24:16.959 --> 00:24:22.919
 But you're calling the top shots experiencing the natural world through five senses.

00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:25.999
 This is not a trite piece of business.

00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:34.639
 Every second you are taking hold and driving the whole machine by the reins.

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:40.939
 It's everything from moving the arms to where you're going to walk to your favorite flavor

00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:42.679
 of ice cream.

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:49.799
 How does something as material as the matter of the mind ever give rise to something as

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:59.159
 intangible as an experience, an idea, or the live stream continuum of thought, which

00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:02.759
 you call you, is not little bitty.

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:09.559
 In fact, the neurosciences, which if you were intellectually honest about it, actually began

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:12.919
 in ancient Egypt and continue to this day.

00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:16.019
 The tools and toys have gotten better.

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:24.819
 As Plato or Aristotle or philosophers all throughout the ages of time, even up until

00:25:24.819 --> 00:25:32.499
 this very moment that you watch this video, would have asked, how does the non-physical

00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:35.059
 control the physical?

00:25:35.059 --> 00:25:37.259
 But the paradox is real.

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:44.779
 The mind-body duality, the split, the place where you have the blurring of the lines between

00:25:44.779 --> 00:25:51.899
 what they'll call the dimension of consciousness and the material world, in fact, it's not

00:25:51.899 --> 00:25:54.699
 just a blurring, fuzziness of the lines.

00:25:54.699 --> 00:26:01.999
 That's the exact point where physical and spiritual twist inside this construct.

00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:08.579
 There are billions and billions and billions of neurons that are all acting with little

00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:13.619
 synapses firing this way and that.

00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:15.699
 It's translating.

00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:17.339
 It's a receiver.

00:26:17.339 --> 00:26:24.739
 Nobel Prize winner neurophysiologist Sir John Eccles stated, and I quote, the human brain

00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:29.259
 is a machine that a ghost can operate.

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:35.979
 So that you can have control of this entire being passing down the spinal cord into the

00:26:35.979 --> 00:26:41.259
 fingertips and every part of your biological body.

00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:43.219
 What are we really?

00:26:43.219 --> 00:26:46.659
 What is the soul?

00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:54.819
 But this is more than just a computer sitting on top of a biological machine.

00:26:54.819 --> 00:27:01.539
 Just like you'll hear researchers ask, what is the source for the digital coding that

00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:05.979
 makes up the software, the DNA of human life?

00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:14.819
 This question here is a granddaddy beyond human imagination, larger in scope than that.

00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:21.259
 In fact, the very type of questions that have pushed many of the greatest minds throughout

00:27:21.259 --> 00:27:25.099
 all time to the brinks of their research.

00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:26.099
 Who are we?

00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:27.099
 Where do we come from?

00:27:27.099 --> 00:27:29.639
 What happens next?

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:37.519
 It was Albert Einstein who said, and I quote, in consideration of the cosmos, the order

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:45.479
 of the universe, which I, with my limited human mind, am able to perceive, yet there

00:27:45.479 --> 00:27:50.839
 are those who say there is no God.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:58.599
 What makes me really angry is when they quote me in support of such views.

00:27:58.599 --> 00:28:01.199
 That was Albert Einstein.

00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:09.159
 It's very rare that you would ever find any quote where Einstein would say he was angry

00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:20.119
 about anything, yet so often I hear men quote Einstein and say that there is no God in the

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:21.599
 same sentence.

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:25.599
 In fact, this is a lot larger in scope than that.

00:28:25.599 --> 00:28:28.679
 Let me put this in perspective for you.

00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:36.439
 Right now, while you're watching this video, we barely understand even the simplest functionings

00:28:36.439 --> 00:28:40.159
 of the smallest parts of this place.

00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:44.359
 We grapple with the DNA strands.

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:50.999
 This right here is a whole lot larger in scope than any of that.

00:28:50.999 --> 00:28:59.999
 Just within the neurosciences, as well as the life sciences sitting right on top.

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:09.439
 Life sciences, neurosciences, and that human mind and consciousness all meet.

00:29:09.439 --> 00:29:17.319
 There is no point in just those two sciences, almost like a gateway, huh?

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:23.639
 We haven't even made it to the quantum physics and the fabric of this place yet.

00:29:23.639 --> 00:29:29.879
 You've probably heard it said that the eyes are the windows to the soul, a statement whose

00:29:29.879 --> 00:29:38.519
 origin is actually derived from Matthew 6.22, but the truth is the illusion is a lot deeper

00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:38.799
 in here.

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:45.599
 scope than that, because it's not actually the eyes that see anything at all.

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:56.839
 The most advanced camera in the world, literally plugged in and tuned to the frequency of the

00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:58.759
 material world.

00:29:58.759 --> 00:30:06.359
 They're collecting the waves of light, which at their base are little quantified digital

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:13.039
 units, packets of light that enter through the eye.

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:15.879
 Solidness is an illusion.

00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:21.799
 And when you're looking at something, you're actually seeing every color it's not.

00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:25.879
 You're seeing the color that it rejects.

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:29.259
 But it's not just about the color of something.

00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:37.379
 If you were to really look at reality, the way that it is, it's comprised of zipping

00:30:37.379 --> 00:30:47.179
 little digits, quantized units, 99.9% empty space.

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:54.819
 Was Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr, who, mind you, gave us an actual model of the atom,

00:30:54.819 --> 00:31:02.019
 who stated, and I quote, those who are not shocked by quantum mechanics have not yet

00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:03.659
 understood it.

00:31:03.659 --> 00:31:11.779
 The fabric of this place, the little data points making up the material world, but it's

00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:19.299
 sufficient at this point to simply understand that what you're looking at is data coming

00:31:19.299 --> 00:31:28.579
 in through the eye, going down the optic nerve, translating into images, and then hits

00:31:28.579 --> 00:31:35.539
 your consciousness, the intangible part of you, plugged in right now, real time, live

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:40.939
 stream all the time, which is calling the shots on the whole show.

00:31:40.939 --> 00:31:47.739
 This very much implies that the real you is much more than the software, the hardware,

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.579
 the biological machine.

00:31:50.579 --> 00:31:55.779
 It does seem like there's a little bit more going on here than what meets the eye.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:32:04.019
 Let me ask you this, if your consciousness is separate from your physical body, and your

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:15.579
 physical body dies, then that would have to mean that you still exist, right?

00:32:15.579 --> 00:32:18.179
 Let that one sink in a minute.

00:32:18.179 --> 00:32:26.779
 Now in the Greek text of Romans 12.2, it says something fascinating, it says, be not conformed

00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:33.299
 to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:41.299
 Now when I think about transformed, I sort of think about a caterpillar in this cocoon

00:32:41.299 --> 00:32:42.299
 state.

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:49.419
 And I'll tell you, when the caterpillar goes into that cocoon, it becomes literally a black

00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:50.419
 goo.

00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:58.579
 It loses all body form inside that cocoon, completely changes.

00:32:58.579 --> 00:33:07.739
 How could the caterpillar ever imagine becoming what it was literally born to become?

00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:13.379
 Sometimes I'll hear physicists say that the universe is really large.

00:33:13.379 --> 00:33:16.659
 My first thought is, compared to what?

00:33:16.659 --> 00:33:18.399
 And we don't know how it does it.

00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:25.139
 How could a body form literally change into something else?

00:33:25.139 --> 00:33:34.059
 Something that beautiful, but yet it does it, as if it's built right in to the program

00:33:34.059 --> 00:33:36.939
 itself.

00:33:36.939 --> 00:33:42.539
 Imagine for a moment that you were a sperm cell, just a little bitty cell.

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:45.699
 And here you are, and you're headed towards the egg.

00:33:45.699 --> 00:33:52.939
 And imagine that you're conscious, and there is no way you could possibly ever imagine

00:33:52.939 --> 00:33:56.699
 what it was that you were born to become.

00:33:56.699 --> 00:34:03.019
 How could it possibly know that it was about to go from its little bitty tiny world to

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:07.179
 one beyond imagination?

00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:13.579
 Now as that sperm cell, you could easily look at other sperm cells that have gone over into

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:18.939
 a corner or some place where they've sort of gathered over here or over here.

00:34:18.939 --> 00:34:23.819
 You could easily get scared or sidetracked, it's a big place.

00:34:23.819 --> 00:34:31.219
 Or you can come into perfect alignment with what you're designed to become.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:37.939
 Imagine straight up keeping your eyes on the prize of that egg, going straight forward

00:34:37.939 --> 00:34:45.939
 and by that mechanism become a victor born to emerge.

00:34:45.939 --> 00:34:53.419
 By the way, even despite the larger scope, which we're going to look at, that does mean

00:34:53.419 --> 00:34:57.419
 that you were a winner at the very start of this thing.

00:34:57.419 --> 00:35:06.499
 No matter how you cut it, that right there is God's greatest gift of a birthday present.

00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:11.979
 You don't get to pick it from the start, but you do get to decide what you're going to

00:35:11.979 --> 00:35:17.299
 do with it, and what voices you're going to listen to.

00:35:17.299 --> 00:35:24.059
 The gatekeeper against, shall we say, any little pushy things?

00:35:24.059 --> 00:35:31.339
 Before we can go larger in scope and look at the full scale of what we're dealing with,

00:35:31.339 --> 00:35:41.139
 I'd like to take a peek at evolution, which states that all of this that we've just discussed

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:45.099
 came out of sheer randomness.

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:50.339
 This is important because these are two entirely different paths.

00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:58.739
 One, the evolution, we just keep getting lucky, lotto win after lotto win, but bottom line,

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:06.819
 random accidents keep mysteriously hitting lotto wins, and it's all internalized.

00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:14.019
 What you see is what you get, and science, and the disconnect, possibly, between the

00:36:14.019 --> 00:36:15.619
 two of them.

00:36:15.619 --> 00:36:24.859
 Or, it's larger in scope, and precision information has a source.

00:36:24.859 --> 00:36:32.339
 The definition of science actually is the study of the material and physical world and

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:40.659
 universe based on observation, experimentation, and investigation.

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:42.579
 So let's investigate it.

00:36:42.579 --> 00:36:47.379
 So, right from the beginning of this thing, we're going to give evolution some really,

00:36:47.379 --> 00:36:52.539
 really big head starts, beginning with the universe itself.

00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:58.059
 At first glance, the universe can sort of look like maybe it's a random place, but in

00:36:58.059 --> 00:37:04.699
 fact we have known for a long time now that the universe is very far from random.

00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:08.099
 This is commonly termed as the anthropic principle.

00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:14.059
 In fact, more than that, if you were to really look at the physics of this place, you would

00:37:14.059 --> 00:37:21.419
 find 1% off this way, 1% off that way, is a bad, bad thing.

00:37:21.419 --> 00:37:25.179
 You and I would not be talking at all.

00:37:25.179 --> 00:37:30.639
 Anthropic means that it has to be exactly the way that it is for us to exist.

00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:36.099
 More than that, when it comes to, say, the cosmological constant, you wouldn't even

00:37:36.099 --> 00:37:44.659
 find an atheist physicist who would tell you that they believed that one was accidental.

00:37:44.659 --> 00:37:51.859
 The fine-tuning of the universe is not a little bitty issue, but nonetheless, we're going

00:37:51.859 --> 00:37:54.819
 to start with the whole package.

00:37:54.819 --> 00:38:01.019
 Evolution gets the universe, the whole construct, and shebang with all of its precision from

00:38:01.019 --> 00:38:03.259
 the beginning for free.

00:38:03.259 --> 00:38:08.859
 And within the inside of that universe, we're throwing in the earth as well.

00:38:08.859 --> 00:38:14.499
 Don't worry about that big number there and all of those impossibilities.

00:38:14.499 --> 00:38:21.019
 We're tossing it into the package for free for evolution as well.

00:38:21.019 --> 00:38:29.459
 Evolution does also appear to defy entropy, the second law of thermodynamics, that things

00:38:29.459 --> 00:38:31.259
 decline over time.

00:38:31.259 --> 00:38:33.979
 We see species go extinct.

00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:41.059
 We don't have one recorded example of a new species ever becoming, but we do have plenty

00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:44.499
 examples of species going away.

00:38:44.499 --> 00:38:48.939
 The dinosaurs would be an example of that.

00:38:48.939 --> 00:38:55.819
 So it violates entropy, but don't worry, we're going to go ahead and give evolution a free

00:38:55.819 --> 00:39:00.339
 pass on that one as well for the purpose of this.

00:39:00.339 --> 00:39:07.339
 It is true that evolution also violates biogenesis, which states, of course, that life only comes

00:39:07.339 --> 00:39:10.739
 from other life.

00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:17.239
 Evolutionist Sir Fred Hoyle stated, and I quote, that believing that the first cell

00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:24.419
 arrived by chance and accident is like believing that a tornado could sweep through a junkyard

00:39:24.419 --> 00:39:27.499
 and create a Boeing 747.

00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:34.499
 It's not just species that we don't see becoming, but on the cellular level, we've never seen

00:39:34.499 --> 00:39:38.459
 a cell come from anything other than another cell.

00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:47.019
 Now just like entropy, we see cells go away, we see them mutate and die, but never see

00:39:47.019 --> 00:39:49.299
 a cell become.

00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:57.019
 Just like the cell, we've also never seen a DNA strand come on its own.

00:39:57.019 --> 00:40:04.099
 Digital coding for life, any kind of life, even the smallest form of life, we've never

00:40:04.099 --> 00:40:07.099
 seen the digital coding become.

00:40:07.099 --> 00:40:12.299
 That's another problem, and you need both simultaneously, but for the purpose of this,

00:40:12.299 --> 00:40:13.299
 we're going to do that.

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:18.979
 It gets the cell, and it gets the coding, both combined from the start.

00:40:18.979 --> 00:40:28.059
 So I need the digital coding for life to happen from inorganic materials somehow, whether

00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:34.699
 it be Moses, sort of a volcano did it, or others proposed lightning struck and produced

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:40.459
 the digital coding, or if you want to view that things were shaking around in sort of

00:40:40.459 --> 00:40:42.499
 a cosmic soup.

00:40:42.499 --> 00:40:51.979
 By some mechanism, I need actual sophisticated code that is tens and tens and tens of thousands

00:40:51.979 --> 00:41:01.739
 of times more advanced than this laptop and the entire computer setup combined in every

00:41:01.739 --> 00:41:03.939
 single strand.

00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:07.139
 It can't have any junk code in there.

00:41:07.139 --> 00:41:14.219
 It's got to be tit for tat on every line, because the digital software is making up

00:41:14.219 --> 00:41:22.979
 the living instructions, click by click by click, line by line, for life itself.

00:41:22.979 --> 00:41:30.179
 But even though the three-dimensional digital coding for just one single strand of DNA is

00:41:30.179 --> 00:41:39.619
 really incredibly complex for us, that's just where it begins to get tough, because

00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:49.699
 now I've got to have trillions and trillions of strands of digital software come together

00:41:49.699 --> 00:42:00.099
 like a perfect glove coordinating in each precision piece to create little bitty fingers

00:42:00.099 --> 00:42:05.699
 and little arms and little legs and little bitty toes.

00:42:05.699 --> 00:42:13.019
 Then I need different kinds of software to all come together for every type of tissue,

00:42:13.019 --> 00:42:22.019
 for the nervous system, for all of the functionality, including the human mind itself.

00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:31.819
 Every organ, every cell, every system, all built and comprised and pulled together from

00:42:31.819 --> 00:42:40.579
 digital software, including all of the billions of neurons that make up the brain.

00:42:40.579 --> 00:42:50.379
 And then, as the final touch, you need the miracle of miracles itself, consciousness.

00:42:50.379 --> 00:42:59.939
 It does sort of seem like an awful lot of very mysterious accidents.

00:42:59.939 --> 00:43:05.339
 Was Dr. Chuck Missler, a man who received congressional appointment to the U.S. Naval

00:43:05.339 --> 00:43:11.979
 Academy, was a former branch chief for the Department of Guided Missiles, serving on

00:43:11.979 --> 00:43:18.219
 the board of directors of a dozen companies, CEO of six of them, helping the Ford Motor

00:43:18.219 --> 00:43:24.459
 Company, where he established the world's first international industrial computer network,

00:43:24.459 --> 00:43:29.859
 and of course becoming one of the largest, at one point, shareholders for Western Digital,

00:43:29.859 --> 00:43:32.299
 who stated, and I quote,

00:43:32.299 --> 00:43:41.179
 It is only when one becomes truly knowledgeable of science itself that one becomes extremely

00:43:41.179 --> 00:43:44.979
 comfortable with the book of Genesis.

00:43:44.979 --> 00:43:51.659
 But don't worry about biogenesis for the purpose of this test of evolution.

00:43:51.659 --> 00:43:57.339
 Not only are we kicking entropy out of the mix, but we're kicking biogenesis out of the

00:43:57.339 --> 00:43:58.939
 mix as well.

00:43:58.939 --> 00:44:06.259
 Not only that, but I'm going to give evolution all of the digital coding that it needs from

00:44:06.259 --> 00:44:07.259
 the start.

00:44:07.259 --> 00:44:12.579
 I'm not going to require it to have to have lightning bolts or cosmic soups.

00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:16.619
 I'm going to give it to it for free from the start.

00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:22.419
 We're also going to need our symbiotic relationships as well.

00:44:22.419 --> 00:44:30.739
 Everything here, most especially the biological living life forms on this planet, are dependent

00:44:30.739 --> 00:44:36.939
 on all sorts of systems, but there went up a mist from the whole

00:44:36.939 --> 00:44:43.859
 earth and watered the face of the ground, if we were intellectually honest about it,

00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:49.019
 the symbiotic relationships that we would need, particularly for the biological stuff

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:56.459
 in a single cell to exist in this place, would be trillions and trillions and trillions and

00:44:56.459 --> 00:45:02.339
 trillions of things when we really began to poke through and see how many things was actually

00:45:02.339 --> 00:45:07.419
 dependent on. And to be intellectually more honest about it, it would probably turn out

00:45:07.419 --> 00:45:14.179
 to be the entirety of all of the systems on the earth itself, or a significant portion

00:45:14.179 --> 00:45:20.699
 of those systems. But just to keep this simple for this test of evolution, we're going to

00:45:20.699 --> 00:45:28.859
 toss all of that stuff out of the mix. In Genesis 1.11 it states, God said, let the

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:37.299
 earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after

00:45:37.299 --> 00:45:47.299
 its kind. Single cell, again, the odds of one cell in this place are 10 to the 39,970

00:45:47.299 --> 00:45:53.739
 to 1. For one single cell, of course anything over 10 to the 50th power in mathematics is

00:45:53.739 --> 00:46:01.299
 considered absolutely absurd. They're believed to be 10 to the 82nd power atoms in the entirety

00:46:01.299 --> 00:46:07.659
 of the universe. But for the purpose of this, we're going to have to, at bare minimum, give

00:46:07.659 --> 00:46:16.219
 our test the symbiotic relationship of at least the plants. And tree yielding fruit

00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:25.779
 whose seed was already in itself after his kind also. And God saw that it was good. We

00:46:25.779 --> 00:46:32.499
 definitely need the plants because we're breathing oxygen in. These plants are really, really

00:46:32.499 --> 00:46:40.379
 critical. Now we need many, many things that are beating those same odds coming into existence

00:46:40.379 --> 00:46:47.539
 simultaneously, like these guys here. And if we were to actually take a deep look into

00:46:47.539 --> 00:46:53.339
 the plants, we're going to find that the systems for the plants that are running the seeds

00:46:53.339 --> 00:47:01.939
 are symbiotic systems as well. You don't get the plant without the seed. And the seed,

00:47:01.939 --> 00:47:08.939
 mind you, is a biological program as well. It's got all of the coating intact with no

00:47:08.939 --> 00:47:15.939
 spare coating to make a plant or a tree. It's got to have all of its little parts doing

00:47:15.939 --> 00:47:22.179
 all of their little jobs from the start. But nonetheless, for the purpose of this test,

00:47:22.179 --> 00:47:27.099
 it gets the cell, it gets the seeds, it gets the trees, it gets the coating, it gets to

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:34.099
 violate the entropy, which we observe every single day that things decline over time,

00:47:34.099 --> 00:47:41.099
 not improve. You and I are also going to give it a free pass on all of the lotto wins that

00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:46.619
 it's got to redundantly win. We're going to give it as many of those as it needs time

00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:53.619
 and time again for the purpose of this test, as well as allowing it to ignore all of the

00:47:53.619 --> 00:47:59.779
 symbiotic relationships, which would have to develop simultaneously. There's another

00:47:59.779 --> 00:48:06.779
 real big one that we're going to have to kick out of the mix. Mendel's Laws of Genetics.

00:48:06.779 --> 00:48:13.779
 Sort of a large third strike, as well as their modern day refinements. It's not like we

00:48:13.779 --> 00:48:20.779
 just started studying genetics yesterday. We're talking about biological software. I

00:48:20.779 --> 00:48:27.779
 hate to even compare DNA strands to any of our stuff. For example, DNA uses 4-bit code.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:34.779
 Our computer software uses 2-bit binary code. Little 1's and little 0's. This is 4-bit.

00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:41.779
 This is 3-dimensional. Each different type of strand of genetic software, the odds against

00:48:41.779 --> 00:48:48.779
 it existing, are 1 in 48, with 48 0's behind it. So that's 1 in 48 octillion to 1 against

00:48:48.779 --> 00:48:55.779
 each piece of digital software existing at all. The programming software has the odds

00:48:55.779 --> 00:49:02.779
 has got to work seamlessly with these cellular factories, which in their inner worlds are

00:49:02.779 --> 00:49:09.779
 more tit-for-tat, precise, more efficient than any computerized, automated factories

00:49:09.779 --> 00:49:16.779
 on the planet Earth. The list of these things could keep on going. DNA is the literal software.

00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:23.779
 The living programming, line-by-line specific, for every single cute, soft, warm, and cuddly,

00:49:23.779 --> 00:49:30.779
 and even the strangest of things. Bottom line, DNA is the software which makes up all of

00:49:30.779 --> 00:49:37.779
 the different types and kinds of species on this planet. Each creature has exactly the

00:49:37.779 --> 00:49:44.779
 coding that it needs to become whatever type, kind, or species of creature that it is. There

00:49:44.779 --> 00:49:51.779
 is no junk code in DNA, nor is there junk code in the cells, which the DNA software

00:49:51.779 --> 00:49:58.779
 runs inside of, or the organs which those cells make up, or the entire functional systems

00:49:58.779 --> 00:50:05.779
 of the living biological organisms themselves. And every type of creature has exactly the

00:50:05.779 --> 00:50:12.779
 same code. Every creature has zero mutating parts on its body that would hinder its chances

00:50:12.779 --> 00:50:19.779
 for survival. If it had things mutating, even worse. If it gets any type of genetic defect

00:50:19.779 --> 00:50:26.779
 or mutation, any type of randomness introduced into this precision, tit-for-tat, line-by-line

00:50:26.779 --> 00:50:33.779
 coding, can not only injure the creature, it can kill it. That's all just the baseline

00:50:33.779 --> 00:50:40.779
 stuff. If we were to leave Mendel's laws of genetics into this test of evolution, that

00:50:40.779 --> 00:50:47.779
 would, let's just say, it kicks up the toughness for this guy here another few trillion notches.

00:50:47.779 --> 00:50:54.779
 The genetic software that makes up a bunny rabbit is entirely different from that that

00:50:54.779 --> 00:51:01.779
 makes up a turtle. The two cannot mate. It is a software disconnect. When you're dealing

00:51:01.779 --> 00:51:08.779
 with biological software, just like dealing with regular software, programming, and the

00:51:08.779 --> 00:51:15.779
 coding has to match up, line-by-line-by-line. Different programs have different coding,

00:51:15.779 --> 00:51:22.779
 and they're only designed to work with specifically the coding that works with each program.

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:29.779
 The genetic coding, the actual digital software, has to match up, line-by-line-by-line, with

00:51:29.779 --> 00:51:36.779
 each program. The genetic coding, the actual digital software inherent in dogs, at least

00:51:36.779 --> 00:51:43.779
 naturally, without any engineering done, any intelligence, or any mucking with the code,

00:51:43.779 --> 00:51:50.779
 the software inherent in dogs will only work, or produce, other breeds, other kinds of dogs.

00:51:50.779 --> 00:51:57.779
 It's only compatible with other dog types. Mendel's laws of genetics apply to every species

00:51:57.779 --> 00:52:04.779
 type on this planet. There are specific body plans from the smallest little things that

00:52:04.779 --> 00:52:11.339
 creep and crawl to the largest creatures on the face of the planet Earth. Same thing applies

00:52:11.339 --> 00:52:18.339
 with horses and those that breed horses. With horses, the genetic code inherent in

00:52:18.339 --> 00:52:25.339
 these creatures is only compatible and can only produce, by any natural cause, other

00:52:25.339 --> 00:52:32.339
 breeds of horses. These genetic laws are particularly important when you're dealing with animals

00:52:32.339 --> 00:52:39.339
 that look very, very similar, if not identical, in many, many ways. They may even have parts

00:52:39.339 --> 00:52:46.339
 within their bodies that are absolutely identical to one another. Appearances can be deceiving.

00:52:46.339 --> 00:52:53.339
 Just like if you had two separate factories with similar or identical machines in each

00:52:53.339 --> 00:53:00.339
 one, yet both factories are running different genetic software. You've probably heard it

00:53:00.339 --> 00:53:07.339
 said that horses, or animals that were like horses, wanted to reach tree branches, which

00:53:07.339 --> 00:53:13.579
 were way up high, so the horses, over time, grew longer and longer necks so that they

00:53:13.579 --> 00:53:20.579
 could get at those taller branches, eventually becoming giraffes. The truth is that the genetic

00:53:20.579 --> 00:53:27.579
 coding for a giraffe and its biological systems are not even remotely close to the systems

00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:34.579
 of that of any type of horse. Just like with computer software, you need a source for every

00:53:34.579 --> 00:53:41.579
 single line of code. Coding does not grow, it does not magically appear, whether it be

00:53:41.579 --> 00:53:48.579
 biological coding or whether it be computer coding, and if you're missing code, if any

00:53:48.579 --> 00:53:55.579
 of the digits are off, your system crashes. Your animal is in trouble. It's not the little

00:53:55.579 --> 00:54:02.579
 train that thought it could. This is real coding that you need for every part, including

00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:09.579
 a different circulatory system. This is not just wishful thinking. I want to click up

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:16.579
 a larger neck. This is real. You need actual tit for tat for tit for tat, line for line

00:54:16.579 --> 00:54:23.579
 for line for line, digital coding for every cell, every function, every part. All the

00:54:23.579 --> 00:54:30.579
 way down the neck of this animal are blood vessels, arteries, which have literal valves.

00:54:30.579 --> 00:54:37.579
 This is going to take more walls of digital coding that will shut off and keep the animal

00:54:37.579 --> 00:54:44.579
 blood so that when it goes down for a drink of water, it will not pass out, which would

00:54:44.579 --> 00:54:51.579
 most definitely injure its chances of survival. If it's trying to run or get away or it passes

00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:57.579
 out and drowns in the pool of water, or if the animal simply passes out every time it

00:54:57.579 --> 00:55:04.579
 goes down for a drink, it's also got special sponge-like material on its mind to capture

00:55:04.579 --> 00:55:11.579
 blood in. Those take more software so that when its neck goes up and down, that it will

00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:18.579
 not again pass out and go unconscious. And to run these extra apparatus of the long neck,

00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:25.579
 it needs a two and a half foot long heart, give or take. Entirely different heart, that's

00:55:25.579 --> 00:55:32.579
 going to be a bunch of these. Pumping all of that circulatory blood through this long

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:39.579
 neck. This isn't just a couple of little knick-knacks that are different. This animal has an entirely

00:55:39.579 --> 00:55:46.579
 different body plan. Software after software after software. If it were missing one piece

00:55:46.579 --> 00:55:53.579
 of any part of this, this animal, the giraffe, would not exist. Once again, from inorganic

00:55:53.579 --> 00:56:00.579
 material, I need trillions of lines of precision three-dimensional software to mysteriously

00:56:00.579 --> 00:56:07.579
 appear. And all of the precision factory machines to ultimately become a giraffe, it cannot

00:56:07.579 --> 00:56:14.579
 stop there. From the inorganic material, it's got to also make trillions of more lines of

00:56:14.579 --> 00:56:21.579
 code. The unbelievable machinery that has to go through and do all of the reading and

00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:28.579
 the duplicating to make complete baby elephants from inorganic material. But, the inorganic

00:56:28.579 --> 00:56:35.579
 material definitely cannot stop there. Buku's and buku's and buku's. Point by point, no

00:56:35.579 --> 00:56:42.579
 nonsense precision in every piece. Hunches of more living, breathing, living, living

00:56:42.579 --> 00:56:49.579
 biological machines to somehow just strangely become. Cells are not just factories, they

00:56:49.579 --> 00:56:56.579
 are literal living, breathing cities. Look at that thing go. Whirlwinds more coding to

00:56:56.579 --> 00:57:03.579
 make lions, alligators, and the most vicious things on the planet Earth. Rivers more code.

00:57:03.579 --> 00:57:11.579
 From more inorganic material to make even the cutest of things.

00:57:11.579 --> 00:57:14.859
 on this planet as well as

00:57:14.859 --> 00:57:17.979
 every single living

00:57:17.979 --> 00:57:22.419
 breathing creature on the face

00:57:22.419 --> 00:57:27.059
 of the planet Earth.

00:57:27.059 --> 00:57:33.659
 It's a lot of lightning bolts. In the construct of this place, the matrix of

00:57:33.659 --> 00:57:37.899
 the material world, this thing that we call reality, the entirety

00:57:37.899 --> 00:57:42.979
 of little particles which make up the universe. Everything here

00:57:42.979 --> 00:57:46.219
 is a causality, a cause

00:57:46.219 --> 00:57:50.459
 and an effect. This becomes particularly important

00:57:50.459 --> 00:57:54.219
 in science when you can see

00:57:54.219 --> 00:57:57.299
 the effect of something

00:57:57.299 --> 00:58:01.379
 but you cannot see the larger scale

00:58:01.379 --> 00:58:05.939
 of what caused it. You know it's also true

00:58:05.939 --> 00:58:11.499
 that a created thing can never understand

00:58:11.499 --> 00:58:15.299
 the scope of what created it.

00:58:15.299 --> 00:58:21.299
 At the inception of the book of Genesis it starts with a fascinating

00:58:21.299 --> 00:58:24.659
 statement. It says, in the beginning

00:58:24.659 --> 00:58:27.859
 the God of gods, Yahweh,

00:58:27.859 --> 00:58:31.779
 created everything. Now the use of the word God

00:58:31.779 --> 00:58:35.179
 in the Hebrew, in that sentence, Yahweh

00:58:35.179 --> 00:58:37.859
 means something a lot larger

00:58:37.859 --> 00:58:41.819
 in scope than Zeus or a man in the clouds

00:58:41.819 --> 00:58:44.939
 with a lightning bolt. It's actually stating

00:58:44.939 --> 00:58:48.299
 in the text that our dad

00:58:48.299 --> 00:58:51.579
 is larger and more unimaginable

00:58:51.579 --> 00:58:56.179
 in scope than the construct of every single

00:58:56.179 --> 00:59:00.019
 three-dimensional particle pixel

00:59:00.019 --> 00:59:03.059
 in the quantum live feed

00:59:03.059 --> 00:59:06.099
 of little dots making up

00:59:06.099 --> 00:59:10.299
 the precision framework of this present

00:59:10.299 --> 00:59:14.499
 illusion, the fabric of the entire

00:59:14.499 --> 00:59:17.859
 place. The text goes on to say

00:59:17.859 --> 00:59:21.339
 and the earth was without form

00:59:21.339 --> 00:59:24.419
 and void. Now in the original Hebrew

00:59:24.419 --> 00:59:29.339
 that sentence actually reads and the earth had become

00:59:29.339 --> 00:59:33.379
 without form and void as if to indicate

00:59:33.379 --> 00:59:36.579
 that the place itself, the entire

00:59:36.579 --> 00:59:39.979
 construct is older

00:59:39.979 --> 00:59:43.499
 than where our story begins.

00:59:43.499 --> 00:59:46.699
 It goes on to say and darkness

00:59:46.699 --> 00:59:50.899
 was on the face of the deep. Now many, many commentators

00:59:50.899 --> 00:59:55.139
 have speculated on that passage that it's talking about the water and the

00:59:55.139 --> 00:59:56.539
 oceans

00:59:56.539 --> 00:59:59.859
 and that is a possibility.

00:59:59.859 --> 01:00:03.539
 What's interesting is that the word darkness

01:00:03.539 --> 01:00:07.139
 is a very, very heavy metaphor

01:00:07.139 --> 01:00:12.579
 word. You know I'm wondering if the text is referring to

01:00:12.579 --> 01:00:16.659
 just regular darkness or

01:00:16.659 --> 01:00:21.099
 if it's referencing something a little deeper

01:00:21.099 --> 01:00:24.259
 than that. And the word waters

01:00:24.259 --> 01:00:27.219
 or celestial waters in

01:00:27.219 --> 01:00:32.019
 every ancient culture meant the entirety

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:35.299
 of the universe, the place where the stars

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:39.219
 are. So it states and the Spirit

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:42.539
 of God moved upon the face

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:46.339
 of the waters and God said

01:00:46.339 --> 01:00:50.219
 let there be light. Now the word light

01:00:50.219 --> 01:00:53.859
 is another extremely

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:57.019
 heavy metaphor word

01:00:57.019 --> 01:01:00.499
 and God saw that the light

01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:04.619
 was good and God divided

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:08.579
 the light from the darkness.

01:01:08.579 --> 01:01:12.539
 What's funny is that even as a human and

01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:15.979
 designing something on a computer

01:01:15.979 --> 01:01:19.459
 per se, what I'll do when I begin a new project

01:01:19.459 --> 01:01:22.979
 is I'll separate my old stuff from my

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:26.739
 new stuff and make a clean slate.

01:01:26.739 --> 01:01:31.539
 It's at that point in the text that you begin

01:01:31.539 --> 01:01:35.259
 with your dramatic rise

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:39.899
 in order in the place itself. This systematic rise

01:01:39.899 --> 01:01:44.859
 almost as systematic and step-by-step precise

01:01:44.859 --> 01:01:49.219
 as the order which rises when a DNA strand

01:01:49.219 --> 01:01:52.899
 opens to become a living, breathing

01:01:52.899 --> 01:01:56.219
 life form. Whatever the case

01:01:56.219 --> 01:02:00.539
 let's swim a little further upstream and see

01:02:00.539 --> 01:02:03.699
 if we can't get our head up above

01:02:03.699 --> 01:02:10.259
 the water. It is true that inorganic material no matter how much you shake it

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:15.819
 or cosmic soup it does not generally start

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.859
 spitting out digital coding.

01:02:18.859 --> 01:02:22.619
 Even dealing with the smallest little microbes

01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:25.699
 on the face of the planet earth like this little virus

01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:31.019
 of E. coli that I've got going on the screen right here. The software has got to be a

01:02:31.019 --> 01:02:32.779
 pre-programmed match

01:02:32.779 --> 01:02:38.139
 on every line just like in a computer program and they can only interbreed

01:02:38.139 --> 01:02:42.819
 within their kind like viruses do lateral gene transfers just as

01:02:42.819 --> 01:02:46.299
 dogs and other animals can only mate within

01:02:46.299 --> 01:02:51.899
 or share genes within their specific track of animals. Turtles with turtles,

01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:53.539
 bunny rabbits with bunny rabbits.

01:02:53.539 --> 01:02:57.299
 Bottom line whether you're dealing with the littlest bug,

01:02:57.299 --> 01:03:01.419
 the largest buffalo or the pristine

01:03:01.419 --> 01:03:04.379
 pentacle of human

01:03:04.379 --> 01:03:08.139
 life itself. You are gonna need

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:13.819
 the source code. Tuck the fact that I brought up viruses into the back your

01:03:13.819 --> 01:03:18.059
 mind. Little bitty guys that like to come into a cell like a little bitty missile

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:21.659
 and convince the host that their voice is the one

01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:26.259
 that the cell should be listening to it before they crawl in there and

01:03:26.259 --> 01:03:29.299
 create a tumor or a cancer and add

01:03:29.299 --> 01:03:32.579
 their code to the mix. Just like what happens

01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:36.059
 on computer software when a virus

01:03:36.059 --> 01:03:39.899
 wiggles its way in. Perhaps also when

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:44.779
 arriving at the dimensional scope of things you not only have

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:48.379
 larger scale issues but perhaps as well

01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:51.379
 there are little buggers and unfriendlies

01:03:51.379 --> 01:03:55.419
 in dimensional structures as well.

01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:59.059
 Oh one more little bitty detail

01:03:59.059 --> 01:04:02.539
 before I forget the amalgamation

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:06.819
 of 66 ancient documents that we call

01:04:06.819 --> 01:04:10.499
 the Holy Bible is redundant to express

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:14.259
 one single message over and over and over and over

01:04:14.259 --> 01:04:18.979
 again that the scope of what's going on here

01:04:18.979 --> 01:04:23.699
 is larger than the planets or the stars

01:04:23.699 --> 01:04:26.899
 or the molecular fabric of the skin

01:04:26.899 --> 01:04:30.699
 or even the quantum particles that make up

01:04:30.699 --> 01:04:34.019
 the matrix of the whole place.

01:04:34.019 --> 01:04:38.099
 That what the creator of the heavens and the earth

01:04:38.099 --> 01:04:41.259
 is interested in has nothing to do

01:04:41.259 --> 01:04:45.299
 with the software, the hardware, the biological

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:49.099
 bag of parts that we call a human body

01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:52.579
 or the roller coaster ride of minutes

01:04:52.579 --> 01:04:55.779
 that we define as a human life

01:04:55.779 --> 01:04:59.499
 but the scope, the precious treasure

01:04:59.499 --> 01:05:04.659
 the gem amongst the darkness that he is seeking out

01:05:04.659 --> 01:05:08.179
 and looking for. He's interested in the real deal

01:05:08.179 --> 01:05:11.339
 the point that's calling all the shots

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:15.699
 for the whole puppet show, the precision parts

01:05:15.699 --> 01:05:18.899
 he's interested in the real you

01:05:18.899 --> 01:05:22.419
 but according to those ancient pages

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:25.379
 it doesn't matter whether you feel like you got served up

01:05:25.379 --> 01:05:29.019
 one coin at the start of this life or 10

01:05:29.019 --> 01:05:33.299
 where you came from or what place on the planet earth

01:05:33.299 --> 01:05:36.019
 you may have been born in truth

01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:40.099
 the particles that make up the human construct

01:05:40.099 --> 01:05:44.259
 are no different than those that make up the bunny rabbit, the turtle

01:05:44.259 --> 01:05:48.299
 or the ground beneath your feet but the scope

01:05:48.299 --> 01:05:53.299
 of the differences in the human conscious condition

01:05:53.299 --> 01:05:59.219
 are larger than the light-year separator between the intellectual capacities

01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:04.179
 between us and any other living breathing creature

01:06:04.179 --> 01:06:08.419
 on the face of the planet earth but according

01:06:08.419 --> 01:06:11.899
 to those pages we are born

01:06:11.899 --> 01:06:15.859
 above things that even these primitive

01:06:15.859 --> 01:06:19.539
 eyes that see like cameras

01:06:19.539 --> 01:06:23.979
 are blind to. What I'm saying is this

01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:27.779
 appearances can be deceiving

01:06:27.779 --> 01:06:31.139
 the world you see with your eyes

01:06:31.139 --> 01:06:34.419
 this place couched

01:06:34.419 --> 01:06:37.739
 in a much larger spiritual

01:06:37.739 --> 01:06:40.859
 dimensional reality

01:06:40.859 --> 01:06:44.139
 the masquerade of particles

01:06:44.139 --> 01:06:47.779
 pretending to be the illusion

01:06:47.779 --> 01:06:51.619
 of the material world. You know it is true

01:06:51.619 --> 01:06:55.699
 whether it be a king or a father

01:06:55.699 --> 01:07:00.619
 you generally see what someone would do with little

01:07:00.619 --> 01:07:05.619
 before you give them much but greater still

01:07:05.619 --> 01:07:10.299
 according to those pages the real you

01:07:10.299 --> 01:07:15.099
 behind the machine infancy stage

01:07:15.099 --> 01:07:20.579
 you were born to be heir to an empire

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:25.219
 the beautiful test that's precisely

01:07:25.219 --> 01:07:29.499
 what those pages are saying

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:35.139
 just thought I'd mention it but before we start looking at a larger scope or a

01:07:35.139 --> 01:07:36.339
 smaller scope

01:07:36.339 --> 01:07:39.699
 in this test of evolution we're gonna have to kick

01:07:39.699 --> 01:07:44.219
 Mendel's laws of genetics out of the queue they conflict

01:07:44.219 --> 01:07:49.819
 with evolution. Now Mendel was a contemporary of Charles Darwin both men

01:07:49.819 --> 01:07:54.459
 lived and worked in roughly the same time period. Mendel's laws

01:07:54.459 --> 01:07:58.819
 of genetics would go on to be well the practical day-to-day observable

01:07:58.819 --> 01:08:02.819
 sciences that are used even this very hour that you're watching

01:08:02.819 --> 01:08:06.339
 this video. They're dependent on sciences because they're observable. We can watch them

01:08:06.339 --> 01:08:11.259
 day after day after day after day after day. Whereas Charles Darwin's

01:08:11.259 --> 01:08:14.859
 theory of evolution would go on to

01:08:14.859 --> 01:08:18.579
 violate lengthy lists of other sciences

01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:22.139
 for example in Darwin's day it was believed that life could

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:26.059
 spontaneously generate by many many folks

01:08:26.059 --> 01:08:30.099
 for example if a mold were to appear perhaps it had

01:08:30.099 --> 01:08:34.099
 spontaneously generated of course we now know that

01:08:34.099 --> 01:08:38.019
 spontaneous generation does not occur

01:08:38.019 --> 01:08:41.939
 Dr. A. Fleischman zoologist at Erlangen

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:47.099
 University who stated and I quote the theory of evolution suffers from the

01:08:47.099 --> 01:08:48.859
 gravest of defects

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:52.179
 which are more and more apparent as time advances

01:08:52.179 --> 01:08:56.219
 it can no longer square with practical scientific knowledge

01:08:56.219 --> 01:09:00.419
 the law of information systems information

01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:06.019
 always has a source. Dr. David A. Kaufman University of Florida Gainesville

01:09:06.019 --> 01:09:06.859
 stated

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:10.099
 evolution lacks a scientifically acceptable

01:09:10.099 --> 01:09:15.379
 explanation for the source of the precisely planned

01:09:15.379 --> 01:09:19.859
 coding within cells without which there can be

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:23.259
 no proteins hence no life

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:27.379
 specified complexity sort of goes hand in hand with the law of information

01:09:27.379 --> 01:09:30.179
 systems what you're looking at

01:09:30.179 --> 01:09:34.819
 is specific information click click click click click click click

01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:38.739
 it is not random little bit this way little bit that way

01:09:38.739 --> 01:09:43.939
 it is direct streamline instructions that build

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:47.459
 living biological organisms

01:09:47.459 --> 01:09:51.139
 irreducible complexity the entirety

01:09:51.139 --> 01:09:55.819
 of that organism is comprised of organs and parts

01:09:55.819 --> 01:10:00.339
 all of which it needs those parts are comprised

01:10:00.339 --> 01:10:04.499
 of cells which require all of their parts

01:10:04.499 --> 01:10:09.699
 those cells are run by digital software which require

01:10:09.699 --> 01:10:13.299
 all of their coding from the information systems

01:10:13.299 --> 01:10:16.659
 to run the inside of the cells

01:10:16.659 --> 01:10:21.459
 all these parts are made of quantum particles which are not

01:10:21.459 --> 01:10:26.419
 random either it is irreducibly complex from bottom

01:10:26.419 --> 01:10:29.659
 to top statistical mathematics

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:33.899
 is not evolution's friend by any stretch

01:10:33.899 --> 01:10:37.219
 at the imagination natural selection

01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:41.019
 if you have two dogs bald dog hairy dog

01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:44.419
 snowstorm comes through environment changes

01:10:44.419 --> 01:10:47.739
 I lose my bald dog I've got less

01:10:47.739 --> 01:10:52.819
 dogs than I started with natural selection or survival

01:10:52.819 --> 01:10:57.019
 the fittest goes hand in hand with entropy as

01:10:57.019 --> 01:11:01.419
 environments change resources go away

01:11:01.419 --> 01:11:06.899
 you see species drop off of the map this is why we observe

01:11:06.899 --> 01:11:11.659
 species die or leave but we do not see

01:11:11.659 --> 01:11:15.499
 new species become natural selection

01:11:15.499 --> 01:11:19.499
 is not a friend of evolution the fossil

01:11:19.499 --> 01:11:24.659
 record Tom Kemp of Oxford University stated and I quote

01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:29.779
 as is well known most fossil species appear

01:11:29.779 --> 01:11:32.979
 instantaneously in the fossil record

01:11:32.979 --> 01:11:36.539
 genetic complexity information

01:11:36.539 --> 01:11:40.619
 theory the truth is that if we were to really go through

01:11:40.619 --> 01:11:45.619
 the entire list of places where there's a hundred and eighty degree

01:11:45.619 --> 01:11:48.780
 conflict with evolution we would be

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:53.459
 here for weeks so I'm gonna rip all of it out

01:11:53.459 --> 01:11:56.739
 right this second toss it to the side

01:11:56.739 --> 01:12:01.019
 level playing field let's put evolution

01:12:01.019 --> 01:12:06.139
 to the test it was in 1859 that Charles Darwin

01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:08.139
 proposed the origin of

01:12:08.139 --> 01:12:14.999
 species, things evolve into other things. So see the dog, he jumped in the water

01:12:14.999 --> 01:12:23.499
 and he is deciding he's going to sort of grow these these fin-like things. See, so

01:12:23.499 --> 01:12:30.339
 the dog ultimately turned into a whale. See how the theory works? Mind you, in

01:12:30.339 --> 01:12:37.699
 1859, when this was proposed by Darwin, it was believed at that time that a

01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:44.339
 single cell was as complex as a ping-pong ball. And God created great

01:12:44.339 --> 01:12:51.259
 whales and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth

01:12:51.259 --> 01:12:59.339
 abundantly after their kinds. So here's one of the proposed charts, or ascent

01:12:59.339 --> 01:13:05.619
 transition lines, for evolution. And you can see the the drawing here is

01:13:05.619 --> 01:13:10.699
 indicating that the fish is growing arms, which are gonna form a different

01:13:10.699 --> 01:13:15.699
 head and become a tail. And now it's it's getting fingers down here. The problems

01:13:15.699 --> 01:13:22.179
 with this are intrinsic, beginning with, of course, the digital programming code

01:13:22.179 --> 01:13:31.539
 of DNA is just like software coding for a program. If a program picks up any junk

01:13:31.539 --> 01:13:41.219
 code, error code, or mutation code into any of the lines of its complete coding,

01:13:41.219 --> 01:13:51.379
 it will by no means make a better program. Even a single human finger is

01:13:51.379 --> 01:14:00.259
 beyond imagination in precision programming scope. But the problems are

01:14:00.259 --> 01:14:06.819
 larger than even the genetics. For practical example, you may have heard it

01:14:06.819 --> 01:14:15.179
 said that dinosaurs became birds. A bird's wings make the neck on the giraffe

01:14:15.179 --> 01:14:23.459
 look like absolute child's play. You are talking about going from a functional

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:32.539
 leg on an animal into an apparatus, a functional apparatus that flies. If you

01:14:32.539 --> 01:14:39.099
 took every piece of sophisticated military hardware for aviation that we

01:14:39.099 --> 01:14:46.739
 have ever devised, collaborated them into one single entity or organism, you would

01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:55.899
 be nowhere close to the sophistication of the systems on one single species of

01:14:55.899 --> 01:15:03.899
 bird. Our best technology, some of it extremely impressive, but also in terms

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:16.579
 of practical reality, primitive, sort of clunky, as well as resource-consuming,

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:26.579
 inefficient, and often very catastrophic by comparison to this creature right

01:15:26.579 --> 01:15:35.739
 here, majesty of just one of these biological masterpieces. The birds sort

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:41.539
 of make the whole flying thing look easy, don't they? Not to mention the fact that

01:15:41.539 --> 01:15:49.699
 if you've got a leg becoming a wing, it's going to be a bad leg long before it

01:15:49.699 --> 01:15:58.619
 makes a good wing. If an animal was mutating in any way, that's going to injure its

01:15:58.619 --> 01:16:06.179
 chances for survival. Not one change of species into another is on record. We

01:16:06.179 --> 01:16:13.819
 cannot prove that a single species has ever changed. That quote is from none

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:22.699
 other than Charles Darwin himself. Now each program on this screen has exactly

01:16:22.699 --> 01:16:28.419
 the coding inside of it that it needs at the very start. Otherwise the program

01:16:28.419 --> 01:16:36.419
 would not exist. So if I've got a monkey that is slowly turning into a person,

01:16:36.419 --> 01:16:45.379
 there has to be actual cellular coding for every little tiny piece of the

01:16:45.379 --> 01:16:53.779
 transition. Just like these computer programs on this screen will only open

01:16:53.779 --> 01:17:02.779
 to become what they are, because their lines of software coding only have the

01:17:02.779 --> 01:17:12.059
 specific line-for-line instructions to open and become whatever the program is.

01:17:12.059 --> 01:17:20.859
 You need precise code for every single line, because just like computer software,

01:17:20.859 --> 01:17:28.379
 this coding has no extra instructions for making spare parts. It has exactly

01:17:28.379 --> 01:17:36.420
 inside those digital instructions the coding that it precisely needs to make

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:44.459
 the organism exactly as it is, with no spare coding. What do you imagine might

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:51.939
 occur if I took one of these programs on this screen and began adding random

01:17:51.939 --> 01:17:58.819
 lines of mutant junk code to one of these programs on this screen? Would it

01:17:58.819 --> 01:18:06.979
 increase and make the program evolve to become a better program? Or option B, do

01:18:06.979 --> 01:18:14.579
 you think that adding random code, junk code and mutation code, to precision

01:18:14.579 --> 01:18:22.539
 genetic software might not ever get a dog to change body plans and all of its

01:18:22.539 --> 01:18:28.539
 genetic coding and become a whale? So what do you think? If we were to add junk

01:18:28.539 --> 01:18:34.339
 code to one of these pieces of software, one of these programs, does the program

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:42.099
 fall apart? Or does it become a better program? And whatever the case, evolution

01:18:42.099 --> 01:18:49.099
 is stating that random accidents in the precision genetic coding began to

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:58.739
 accidentally spit out every direction and every kind of creature and species

01:18:58.739 --> 01:19:06.219
 on the planet Earth. Despite the entropy, biogenesis and all of Mendel's laws of

01:19:06.219 --> 01:19:13.659
 genetics, and also ignoring all of these basic day-to-day observable sciences, one

01:19:13.659 --> 01:19:19.699
 would anticipate that the evidence for all of these transitions, which would

01:19:19.699 --> 01:19:25.779
 have to occur, spitting out mutant animals and creatures in every

01:19:25.779 --> 01:19:33.259
 conceivable direction, should be readily available and easy to find within the

01:19:33.259 --> 01:19:39.819
 fossil record. Strangely though, the evidence on the entire face of the

01:19:39.819 --> 01:19:47.779
 whole planet Earth for all of this science-defying activity seem to be

01:19:47.779 --> 01:19:56.939
 primarily confined to this single set of monkey bones. Jeffrey Schwartz, in his

01:19:56.939 --> 01:20:00.819
 book, Sudden Origin, stated, and I quote,

01:20:00.819 --> 01:20:08.659
 Given that evolution, according to Darwin, was in a continual state of motion, it follows

01:20:08.659 --> 01:20:15.539
 logically that the fossil record should be rife with examples of transitional

01:20:15.539 --> 01:20:22.659
 fossils, leading from less to more evolved. Yet instead of filling in the

01:20:22.659 --> 01:20:28.219
 gaps in the fossil record with so-called missing links, most

01:20:28.219 --> 01:20:35.219
 paleontologists have found themselves in a situation where there are only gaps in

01:20:35.219 --> 01:20:42.939
 the fossil record, with no evidence of transformational, intermediate, between

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:51.580
 documented fossil species. So despite just what Charles Darwin said in his own

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:58.460
 day, that there is no evidence of species changing from one to another, and the

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:05.780
 fossil record working to further illustrate that animals stay within

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:12.900
 their spectrums, not seeming to have fossils that change into one another.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:17.979
 Ben Eldredge stated in his book, The Myths of Human Evolution, and I quote,

01:21:17.979 --> 01:21:27.979
 The fossil record flatly fails to substantiate the expectation of finely graded changes over time.

01:21:27.979 --> 01:21:33.499
 Despite all of that, the fossil record and all of the sciences, let's go a tad bit

01:21:33.499 --> 01:21:39.859
 deeper. Because one would think, if you were going to search for evolution, surely

01:21:39.859 --> 01:21:46.499
 you would find it in the simplest of insects. Now it is true that since the

01:21:46.499 --> 01:21:51.499
 early 1900s, almost a hundred years now, we've been doing fruit fly experiments.

01:21:51.499 --> 01:21:58.059
 Tens of thousands, probably millions of generations of fruit flies at this point

01:21:58.059 --> 01:22:02.259
 have been bred in labs and they do all sorts of weird stuff to them to try and

01:22:02.259 --> 01:22:06.939
 encourage mutations. They're trying to get them to have a mutation that has a

01:22:06.939 --> 01:22:11.219
 genetic benefit as well as pass it on. Basically they're trying to prove

01:22:11.219 --> 01:22:16.979
 evolution. At this point, with tens of thousands of these that have occurred,

01:22:16.979 --> 01:22:23.539
 the statement that arrives from the fruit fly experiments is that they

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:27.819
 appear to be immune to evolution. And they use the fruit flies because they

01:22:27.819 --> 01:22:32.179
 have short lifespans, about 11 days. On top of that, the flies are really

01:22:32.179 --> 01:22:37.219
 inexpensive, they're cheap. In fact, was it not Morris Corry who said, out of our 400

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:41.739
 mutations, there's not one that can be called a new species. Or Norman Macbeth

01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:47.059
 who quoted, if a thousand mutations were combined all into one specimen, we still

01:22:47.059 --> 01:22:54.059
 would not have a new species. So this guy here is a motor protein headed towards

01:22:54.059 --> 01:22:59.419
 the nucleus of the cell on these little bitty highways. Or perhaps you may

01:22:59.419 --> 01:23:05.859
 prefer Francis Hitching, hardcore atheist, mind you, who stated, and I quote,

01:23:05.859 --> 01:23:10.299
 fruit flies refuse to become anything other than fruit flies under any

01:23:10.299 --> 01:23:19.499
 circumstances yet devised. He's battery charged by the mitochondria. Or just for

01:23:19.499 --> 01:23:23.460
 good measure, how about Gordon R. Taylor who stated, it's striking that geneticists

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:28.580
 have been breeding fruit flies for more than 60 years all around the world. Flies

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:34.140
 which produce a new generation every 11 days. Yet they have never seen the

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:41.499
 emergence of even as much as a new enzyme. And these guys here are little

01:23:41.499 --> 01:23:47.219
 bitty turbines which are turning and they're powering billions of little

01:23:47.219 --> 01:23:53.340
 mitochondria batteries. But even if you find deterioration in the insects and

01:23:53.340 --> 01:24:00.140
 you can't find evolution in them, surely at least you could find some kind of

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:06.739
 improvements happening even in the microscopic world. Little bitty cells,

01:24:06.739 --> 01:24:11.299
 wouldn't you think? And it's not just the fruit flies that they've been trying

01:24:11.299 --> 01:24:15.659
 this mutation thing on, mind you. Michigan State University evolutionary

01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:21.619
 biologist Richard Lenski and his colleagues have searched for signs of

01:24:21.619 --> 01:24:25.900
 evolution in bacteria. Single-celled bacteria now for more than 20 years

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:32.819
 tracking more than 40,000 generations. And in the end, right now up until today,

01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:40.659
 every part of the cell is doing a job that functions some other part have been

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:48.859
 at bare minimum just lateral most in sheer volume. Degenerative. A fact which

01:24:48.859 --> 01:24:53.799
 caused University of Bristol bacteriology professor Alan Linton to

01:24:53.799 --> 01:25:00.239
 state, where's the experimental evidence? None exists in the entire history of

01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:05.479
 mankind more importantly the history of science itself on the entire earth.

01:25:05.479 --> 01:25:15.119
 There's not one experimental example to date of a cell mutating one single

01:25:15.119 --> 01:25:21.719
 upward notch of function or new improvement. And it's not for lack of

01:25:21.719 --> 01:25:27.919
 trying, interestingly enough. Where's the experimental evidence? Alan Linton

01:25:27.919 --> 01:25:35.799
 continues. None exists bacteria with generation times of 20 to 30 minutes but

01:25:35.799 --> 01:25:43.039
 throughout the hundred and fifty years of the science of bacteriology there is

01:25:43.039 --> 01:25:50.959
 no evidence that one species of bacteria has ever changed into another

01:25:50.959 --> 01:25:57.599
 despite the fact that populations have been exposed to potent chemical and

01:25:57.599 --> 01:26:04.919
 physical mutagens. The cell needs all of its parts to function. Those parts all

01:26:04.919 --> 01:26:10.519
 work together as a whole. If something comes in like a virus attacks the cell

01:26:10.519 --> 01:26:16.439
 or the cell mutates for some reason this not only can injure its chances of

01:26:16.439 --> 01:26:23.159
 survival but more than that can actually kill the cell can destroy the cell. It

01:26:23.159 --> 01:26:28.719
 has to be healthy and functional with all of its pieces doing their jobs. If

01:26:28.719 --> 01:26:34.759
 something comes in and interferes with that it doesn't become a better cell.

01:26:34.759 --> 01:26:40.799
 Alan continues, since there is no evidence for species changes between

01:26:40.799 --> 01:26:49.159
 even the simplest forms of unicellular life. Is it not surprising, he continues,

01:26:49.159 --> 01:26:57.119
 that there is no evidence for evolution throughout the whole array of

01:26:57.119 --> 01:27:05.399
 multicellular life on this planet. That was Dr. Alan Linton. The biological life

01:27:05.399 --> 01:27:06.399
 forms on this planet

01:27:06.399 --> 01:27:13.799
 are not just comprised of little bitty cellular factories that are more sophisticated than

01:27:13.799 --> 01:27:21.519
 every single automated factory on earth combined into a space so small that you can barely

01:27:21.519 --> 01:27:28.679
 see it with our largest microscopes and then run with digital precision software.

01:27:28.679 --> 01:27:36.539
 But the inside of those cells are made of little bitty machines all doing things so

01:27:36.539 --> 01:27:40.879
 that you and I can even exist at all.

01:27:40.879 --> 01:27:46.779
 Was Dr. Doug Axe and Dr. Ann Goger that came up with these numbers here.

01:27:46.779 --> 01:27:52.719
 Assuming you started with your complete cell, your complete earth, and you've got your digital

01:27:52.719 --> 01:28:00.839
 software running inside the cell, now you need coordinated mutations, coordinated accidents

01:28:00.839 --> 01:28:06.399
 to occur within these strands on the DNA.

01:28:06.399 --> 01:28:17.119
 So to get six coordinated mutations to produce one new beneficial function on the inside

01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:23.959
 of a single cell would take 16 billion years.

01:28:23.959 --> 01:28:29.999
 Sixteen billion years is the currently believed age of the entire universe.

01:28:29.999 --> 01:28:34.159
 I didn't like their numbers so I kicked it way up.

01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:35.559
 Why not?

01:28:35.559 --> 01:28:44.439
 The one trillion coordinated mutations, that would be almost enough for one earthworm.

01:28:44.439 --> 01:28:45.559
 Give or take.

01:28:45.559 --> 01:28:49.879
 On this planet, which shouldn't mathematically be here.

01:28:49.879 --> 01:28:57.159
 If we were to speed him up, he's actually walking a lot faster than that.

01:28:57.159 --> 01:28:59.279
 I don't know.

01:28:59.279 --> 01:29:02.119
 Just doesn't look random to me.

01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:10.439
 You know I'm thinking that the answers could very easily be a little bit larger in scope.

01:29:10.439 --> 01:29:17.999
 Maybe the history of the place might could bring some illumination.

01:29:17.999 --> 01:29:19.999
 This is Dr. Jack Horner.

01:29:19.999 --> 01:29:25.759
 Now Jack was a technical advisor on the 1991 movie Jurassic Park.

01:29:25.759 --> 01:29:29.279
 He was doing an archeological dig when they found...

01:29:29.279 --> 01:29:33.639
 The scientific world is still reeling from the discovery of actual Tyrannosaurus Rex

01:29:33.639 --> 01:29:38.839
 cells and soft tissue unearthed last week at a Montana excavation site.

01:29:38.839 --> 01:29:46.079
 Now since that first discovery of actual soft tissue inside T-Rex bones, I've heard many

01:29:46.079 --> 01:29:55.759
 many commentators suggest that to get the date of extremely alive looking soft tissue

01:29:55.759 --> 01:30:04.079
 like this actual image of T-Rex soft tissue on the screen right here, you don't want to

01:30:04.079 --> 01:30:10.439
 actually test the meaty looking dinosaur tissue itself.

01:30:10.439 --> 01:30:12.519
 That would be a big no-no.

01:30:12.519 --> 01:30:19.639
 What you want to do apparently is test the rocks which are around the soft tissue.

01:30:19.639 --> 01:30:21.719
 You don't want to test the soft tissue.

01:30:21.719 --> 01:30:27.039
 You want to test the rocks which are around the soft tissue.

01:30:27.039 --> 01:30:32.639
 Well I mean, the elephant in the room is that when you're dealing with tissue that looks

01:30:32.639 --> 01:30:42.719
 that fresh with blood vessels, then your animal is probably not 65 million years old.

01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:50.079
 Here's how long living tissue lasts, and somewhere three or four football fields that way is

01:30:50.079 --> 01:30:52.319
 65 million years.

01:30:52.319 --> 01:30:56.599
 You know Mary, when I was reading about this story, I was amazed that in some of the capillaries

01:30:56.599 --> 01:30:59.519
 when you went to pull them, they snapped right back.

01:30:59.519 --> 01:31:01.879
 Are you amazed at the quality of these remains?

01:31:01.879 --> 01:31:02.879
 Absolutely.

01:31:02.879 --> 01:31:04.879
 70 million years old, huh?

01:31:04.879 --> 01:31:09.279
 It's just doesn't seem possible, but yes you can actually take the vessels and they do

01:31:09.279 --> 01:31:14.159
 have internal components and so you can take a probe and kind of squeeze those things out

01:31:14.159 --> 01:31:16.999
 into solution and the vessels are fine.

01:31:16.999 --> 01:31:19.799
 It's just I can't explain it to be honest.

01:31:19.799 --> 01:31:20.799
 Very cool.

01:31:20.799 --> 01:31:23.079
 I have a lot of respect for Jack Horner.

01:31:23.079 --> 01:31:25.899
 Let me put this in perspective for you.

01:31:25.899 --> 01:31:34.339
 This man here on the screen released a discovery that he made which disagrees with many of

01:31:34.339 --> 01:31:38.899
 his own conjectures about dinosaurs.

01:31:38.899 --> 01:31:45.779
 You got to admit though Jack, despite all of the agendas or voices that may be out there

01:31:45.779 --> 01:31:54.419
 concerning fossils, it's almost like somebody placed the bigger thing right in the palm

01:31:54.419 --> 01:31:55.899
 of your hand.

01:31:55.899 --> 01:31:59.499
 But in truth, it's not just the old T-Rex.

01:31:59.499 --> 01:32:05.499
 The soft tissue is being discovered inside of, for example, this 70 million year old

01:32:05.499 --> 01:32:13.819
 Mosasaur tissue found or perhaps this claimed 80 million year old Hadrosaur on the screen

01:32:13.819 --> 01:32:14.819
 right here.

01:32:14.819 --> 01:32:20.539
 Look at how gooey and fresh that tissue looks right there on the screen.

01:32:20.539 --> 01:32:28.979
 The list of these could keep on going and the truth is I'm not terribly surprised.

01:32:28.979 --> 01:32:38.779
 The word dinosaur or dinosauria, meaning terrible lizard, did not exist until 1841.

01:32:38.779 --> 01:32:44.299
 Prior to that the name was dragon, meaning the big lizard that you definitely did not

01:32:44.299 --> 01:32:45.739
 want to run across.

01:32:45.739 --> 01:32:52.179
 It's not just that there are redundancies of drawings of these things all over the face

01:32:52.179 --> 01:32:58.499
 of the planet Earth, but there are thousands of writings about these creatures and sculptures

01:32:58.499 --> 01:33:05.379
 found everywhere from the smallest little bitty tribes to the largest empires.

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:09.899
 In truth, who could actually count how many dragon stories that there are on the face

01:33:09.899 --> 01:33:15.379
 of the planet Earth accompanied with drawings of the creatures.

01:33:15.379 --> 01:33:25.379
 In fact, the old science book Historia Animalium claims that in the 1500's dragons, dinosaurs,

01:33:25.379 --> 01:33:30.819
 were extremely rare but were still existent at that time.

01:33:30.819 --> 01:33:32.739
 You couldn't make this stuff up.

01:33:32.739 --> 01:33:38.459
 Alexander the Great wrote about dinosaur dragons in India.

01:33:38.459 --> 01:33:45.859
 Herodotus, the Greek historian from the 4th century BC, often called the father of history

01:33:45.859 --> 01:33:52.859
 itself, not only wrote about dragons but did a fantastic job giving descriptions of these

01:33:52.859 --> 01:34:01.179
 creatures and gave a step-by-step walkthrough of how the Egyptians would smoke out the pterodactyls

01:34:01.179 --> 01:34:02.659
 from the trees.

01:34:02.659 --> 01:34:09.539
 Aristotle, Greek philosopher from the 3rd century BC, also gave eyewitness accounts

01:34:09.539 --> 01:34:18.219
 to these large reptile creatures, dragons, as well as descriptions of the flying lizards

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:26.499
 similar to the thunderbird or pterodactyl head found at the top of Indian prayer sticks.

01:34:26.499 --> 01:34:34.419
 Marco Polo, the explorer from the 12th to 13th century AD, gave incredible accounts

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:41.059
 about large dragon beasts in the chronicles and records of his journeys.

01:34:41.059 --> 01:34:49.379
 And we can be pretty certain that they weren't telling these dinosaur dragon stories as myths

01:34:49.379 --> 01:34:54.059
 because we've got the bones for them.

01:34:54.059 --> 01:34:58.019
 Complete with the gooey, fresh and soft dragon tissue.

01:34:58.019 --> 01:35:05.479
 I could pretty easily be persuaded to believe that the person that drew all of these lines

01:35:05.479 --> 01:35:13.459
 on this icca stone right here knew what a triceratops looked like.

01:35:13.459 --> 01:35:18.379
 And here's a guy riding on top of a triceratops.

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:26.779
 Any man brave enough to hop onto the back of a triceratops is absolutely worthy of the

01:35:26.779 --> 01:35:30.019
 honor to be drawn on a rock.

01:35:30.019 --> 01:35:36.539
 I think it would also be extremely difficult to convince the Asian cultures that there

01:35:36.539 --> 01:35:38.779
 weren't dragons.

01:35:38.779 --> 01:35:46.019
 In truth, you could spend hours going through all of the inscriptions found all across the

01:35:46.019 --> 01:35:47.779
 ancient world.

01:35:47.779 --> 01:35:57.859
 And the amazing thing is how remarkably similar many of the reliefs are to actual bone structures

01:35:57.859 --> 01:36:02.979
 that we find fossilized underneath the earth.

01:36:02.979 --> 01:36:09.059
 Look at this enormous Chinese lizard grabbing hold of that deer right there.

01:36:09.059 --> 01:36:22.059
 In fact, the Chinese zodiac has eleven regular day-to-day animals on it as well as one dragon.

01:36:22.059 --> 01:36:28.419
 You know the real fascinating thing about dinosaurs though, they're found underground,

01:36:28.419 --> 01:36:33.519
 mixed in under there with other animals that we still see every day.

01:36:33.519 --> 01:36:42.519
 So if I've got a real big animal that's on top of the ground and it dies, how does it

01:36:42.519 --> 01:36:47.359
 get buried underneath the earth?

01:36:47.359 --> 01:36:52.839
 If an animal dies on the surface of the ground, whether it be a giraffe, I mean it can't sink

01:36:52.839 --> 01:36:53.839
 down there.

01:36:53.839 --> 01:36:56.119
 I mean this is a real big animal.

01:36:56.119 --> 01:37:03.599
 Or a bronchiosaurus on top of the ground, solar dust can't fall on it.

01:37:03.599 --> 01:37:07.079
 How does something this size get down there?

01:37:07.079 --> 01:37:14.879
 These enormous animals are commonly found in mass underground dinosaur graveyards, literal

01:37:14.879 --> 01:37:22.439
 mass burials, as if the creatures were herding and whatever happened, happened all at once

01:37:22.439 --> 01:37:25.679
 fast and unexpected.

01:37:25.679 --> 01:37:30.559
 If it dies on the surface, it's just going to decompose and other things are going to

01:37:30.559 --> 01:37:31.879
 come along and eat it.

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:37.799
 It's definitely not going to sink down under the earth, become compressed and turn into

01:37:37.799 --> 01:37:40.239
 a fossil on its own.

01:37:40.239 --> 01:37:45.159
 Now it is true that liquefaction would do that, I mean it would throw all sorts of stuff

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:50.279
 underneath the ground, including your fossilized fish, your dinosaurs and all of these big

01:37:50.279 --> 01:37:51.279
 animals.

01:37:51.279 --> 01:37:56.319
 It would even divvy up your strata if you had water that was pumping around and loosening

01:37:56.319 --> 01:38:01.199
 up the sediments of the ground and then you'd get your layers.

01:38:01.199 --> 01:38:07.839
 But for that to happen, you would need an awful lot of water and these guys here would

01:38:07.839 --> 01:38:16.559
 settle into those different strata, pumping around on the surface of the ground.

01:38:16.559 --> 01:38:21.519
 This increasing pressure in the subterranean water steadily stretched the crust as a balloon

01:38:21.519 --> 01:38:24.039
 stretches when the pressure inside increases.

01:38:24.039 --> 01:38:31.639
 Failure in the crust began as a microscopic crack that grew in both directions at almost

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.519
 three miles per second.

01:38:33.519 --> 01:38:40.159
 The crack, following the path of least resistance, encircled the globe in about two hours.

01:38:40.159 --> 01:38:44.399
 As the crack raced around the earth, the overlying rock crust opened up like a rip in a tightly

01:38:44.399 --> 01:38:45.399
 stretched cloth.

01:38:45.399 --> 01:38:49.479
 So the water exploded violently out of the rupture.

01:38:49.479 --> 01:38:55.759
 The 12 stone tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest written epic in the world.

01:38:55.759 --> 01:39:04.399
 The actual records of the King of Uruk, believed to be one of the oldest settlements following

01:39:04.399 --> 01:39:11.439
 the global flood, which is one of the focal points of the entire document.

01:39:11.439 --> 01:39:16.839
 Some of the water jetting high above the cold stratosphere froze into supercooled ice crystals

01:39:16.839 --> 01:39:23.759
 and produced some massive ice dumps, burying, suffocating and instantly freezing many animals,

01:39:23.759 --> 01:39:26.839
 including the frozen mammoths of Siberia and Alaska.

01:39:26.839 --> 01:39:35.839
 This is a Sumerian Kings list, which not only tells us about a worldwide global flood, but

01:39:35.839 --> 01:39:40.639
 also gives us a helpful hand with maybe the date.

01:39:40.639 --> 01:39:45.679
 The supersonic fountains eroded the crumbling rock on both sides of the widening crack.

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:50.999
 This produced huge volumes of sediments that settled through the flood waters, trapping

01:39:50.999 --> 01:39:55.679
 and burying plants and animals, forming the fossil record.

01:39:55.679 --> 01:40:00.919
 Eventually the crack became so wide that the newly exposed floor of the subterranean chamber

01:40:00.919 --> 01:40:05.719
 sprung upward, giving birth to the mid-oceanic ridge that wraps around the earth like the

01:40:05.719 --> 01:40:07.359
 seam of a baseball.

01:40:07.359 --> 01:40:12.439
 The continental plates, with lubricating water still beneath them, slid downhill away from

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:15.839
 the rising mid-Atlantic ridge.

01:40:15.839 --> 01:40:20.599
 After the massive, slowly accelerating continental plates reached speeds of approximately 40

01:40:20.599 --> 01:40:27.679
 to 50 miles per hour, they ran into resistances, and like a runaway crashing train, they compressed,

01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:33.199
 crushed, buckled and thickened, rising out of the flood waters.

01:40:33.199 --> 01:40:36.999
 This is why the major mountains are generally parallel to the oceanic ridges from which

01:40:36.999 --> 01:40:37.999
 they slid.

01:40:37.999 --> 01:40:43.719
 Today's major mountains were all pushed up in hours.

01:40:43.719 --> 01:40:51.199
 There are 277 flood stories from cultures around the globe.

01:40:51.199 --> 01:40:56.399
 Some will argue that number is more like 2,000, but any way you cut it, there are a lot of

01:40:56.399 --> 01:41:06.319
 flood stories, including a man and his three sons and their wives surviving a global flood

01:41:06.319 --> 01:41:07.959
 on a boat.

01:41:07.959 --> 01:41:14.359
 There's only one text on the face of the planet Earth that gives the measurements of that

01:41:14.359 --> 01:41:23.639
 vessel, and that would most definitely be the Hebrew text of the book of Genesis.

01:41:23.639 --> 01:41:29.399
 Measurements given to us in the book of Genesis for Noah's Ark are given to us in cubits.

01:41:29.399 --> 01:41:32.999
 You've got the Egyptian cubit, the Babylonian cubit.

01:41:32.999 --> 01:41:39.079
 Now a cubit is thought to be the measurement from the tip of the finger to the elbow.

01:41:39.079 --> 01:41:41.079
 So what is that?

01:41:41.079 --> 01:41:46.619
 For the sake of argument, I went with the lowest possible numbers for the measurement

01:41:46.619 --> 01:41:49.119
 of Noah's Ark and its interior.

01:41:49.119 --> 01:41:53.599
 Amphibians, well, I mean, they're amphibians.

01:41:53.599 --> 01:41:58.639
 The survival mechanisms on many, many animals are just astounding.

01:41:58.639 --> 01:42:03.839
 Did you know that certain types of frogs, like this wood frog here, can actually freeze

01:42:03.839 --> 01:42:05.079
 in a pond over there?

01:42:05.079 --> 01:42:08.479
 over the entire winter and reanimate,

01:42:08.479 --> 01:42:10.399
 literally come back to life.

01:42:10.399 --> 01:42:15.399
 So the craft itself is 75 foot wide,

01:42:15.399 --> 01:42:18.359
 would be 450 feet in length,

01:42:18.359 --> 01:42:20.879
 all the way to the end of that boat down there,

01:42:20.879 --> 01:42:25.559
 and it would be 45 feet, three stories tall.

01:42:25.559 --> 01:42:28.879
 So at its smallest possible measurements,

01:42:28.879 --> 01:42:32.679
 that's longer than a football field by a lot.

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:35.319
 Now insects will definitely fit on the boat,

01:42:35.319 --> 01:42:37.679
 and there's no argument about that part of it,

01:42:37.679 --> 01:42:40.279
 but when it comes to insects,

01:42:40.279 --> 01:42:42.599
 they'll pretty much make it through anything,

01:42:42.599 --> 01:42:47.599
 or the larva, or hitch a ride on all of the floating stuff.

01:42:47.599 --> 01:42:50.399
 Cockroaches will survive anything.

01:42:50.399 --> 01:42:54.719
 Just like in Mendel's laws of genetics,

01:42:54.719 --> 01:42:59.719
 how many genetic lines of parent creatures

01:42:59.719 --> 01:43:04.719
 do I need to create the spectrums and arrays

01:43:04.719 --> 01:43:09.719
 of animal species that we see on this planet?

01:43:09.719 --> 01:43:12.559
 So this is roughly your layout.

01:43:12.559 --> 01:43:17.559
 You've got 98% sea life, amphibians, insects, bacteria,

01:43:17.559 --> 01:43:18.599
 and actually those numbers

01:43:18.599 --> 01:43:21.039
 would probably be larger than that

01:43:21.039 --> 01:43:23.599
 if you tossed in all of your different funguses

01:43:23.599 --> 01:43:25.599
 and plant life as well.

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:27.439
 In comparison to the qualifying animals

01:43:27.439 --> 01:43:29.799
 that you would need on that vessel,

01:43:29.799 --> 01:43:34.719
 which would be your land mammals, reptiles, and birds.

01:43:34.719 --> 01:43:37.439
 The Russian silver fox experiments

01:43:37.439 --> 01:43:40.999
 going on now for more than 50 years

01:43:40.999 --> 01:43:45.279
 are one of the more beautiful examples of animals,

01:43:45.279 --> 01:43:48.199
 in this case foxes, producing,

01:43:48.199 --> 01:43:51.319
 limited to their genetic kinds,

01:43:51.319 --> 01:43:56.319
 the array of variables and appearances within animal types.

01:43:56.319 --> 01:43:58.639
 Look at this first silver fox here.

01:43:58.639 --> 01:44:00.799
 Now look at this silver fox,

01:44:00.799 --> 01:44:04.999
 as well as these cute little silver fox variations

01:44:04.999 --> 01:44:08.359
 produced within the 50-year ongoing

01:44:08.359 --> 01:44:11.599
 Russian silver fox experiments.

01:44:11.599 --> 01:44:16.359
 This is commonly termed as microevolution,

01:44:16.359 --> 01:44:21.359
 meaning that the species can work with preexisting code

01:44:21.359 --> 01:44:25.319
 within their animal kinds,

01:44:25.319 --> 01:44:30.319
 which is grandly different than Darwinian evolution

01:44:30.319 --> 01:44:35.319
 where things are becoming other creatures and transforming.

01:44:35.319 --> 01:44:40.319
 These animals are restricted within their animal kinds.

01:44:40.319 --> 01:44:45.319
 Bottom line, this fox can have other variations of foxes,

01:44:45.319 --> 01:44:50.319
 but its genetic coding does not contain the information

01:44:50.319 --> 01:44:53.839
 to turn into a whale.

01:44:53.839 --> 01:44:56.279
 Actually, genetically speaking,

01:44:56.279 --> 01:44:59.999
 everything on this planet is losing genetic information.

01:44:59.999 --> 01:45:02.919
 This is particularly observable in viruses,

01:45:02.919 --> 01:45:04.959
 but in all the creatures on the planet,

01:45:04.959 --> 01:45:09.399
 we're actually degrading, just like with entropy,

01:45:09.399 --> 01:45:12.599
 and losing species counts.

01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:16.279
 The current numbers on extinction rate

01:45:16.279 --> 01:45:20.799
 are anywhere between 1,000 species a year to 10,000

01:45:20.799 --> 01:45:24.319
 between all of these types of creatures,

01:45:24.319 --> 01:45:26.679
 and depending on whose numbers that you listen to,

01:45:26.679 --> 01:45:30.239
 but we're certainly losing things and not gaining them.

01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:34.439
 And the same applies to our genetic coding.

01:45:34.439 --> 01:45:37.999
 So, in theory, if you rewound time,

01:45:37.999 --> 01:45:41.399
 the genetic coding in the past,

01:45:41.399 --> 01:45:44.959
 further up this line, would be stronger.

01:45:44.959 --> 01:45:47.719
 Whatever the case, it was John Woodmarappy

01:45:47.719 --> 01:45:50.319
 that came up with these numbers here.

01:45:50.319 --> 01:45:53.439
 She would need 8,000 genera,

01:45:53.439 --> 01:45:58.439
 actual couples or 8,000 family kinds,

01:45:58.439 --> 01:46:01.879
 to produce the spectrums of creatures

01:46:01.879 --> 01:46:05.999
 that we see on this planet right now today.

01:46:05.999 --> 01:46:10.719
 That number makes provision for the extinction rate

01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:13.399
 as well as, interestingly enough,

01:46:13.399 --> 01:46:15.639
 he packed in all of the dinosaurs

01:46:15.639 --> 01:46:18.359
 into that figure, by the way.

01:46:18.359 --> 01:46:20.919
 So I went with the smallest measurements

01:46:20.919 --> 01:46:24.919
 of the interior of the boat for Noah's Ark,

01:46:24.919 --> 01:46:28.079
 but now we're gonna take that a step further.

01:46:28.079 --> 01:46:31.679
 Scratch out those numbers of 8,000,

01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:34.759
 times them by almost four,

01:46:34.759 --> 01:46:39.759
 kick it up to 30,000 kinds crammed in to the boat.

01:46:39.759 --> 01:46:42.359
 That vessel on the screen right there

01:46:42.359 --> 01:46:47.279
 could hold the equivalent of 522

01:46:47.279 --> 01:46:50.839
 full-size railroad boxcars.

01:46:50.839 --> 01:46:55.839
 In layman's terms, that would be 125,000 full-size sheep.

01:46:55.839 --> 01:46:58.839
 Most of these animal kinds,

01:46:58.839 --> 01:47:02.259
 which again, I bumped the number way up on,

01:47:02.259 --> 01:47:07.259
 are nowhere close to the size of a full-sized sheep.

01:47:07.259 --> 01:47:09.259
 It's a lot of boat.

01:47:09.259 --> 01:47:14.259
 How many times does 30,000 go into 125,000?

01:47:14.259 --> 01:47:17.659
 And 30,000 is four times

01:47:17.659 --> 01:47:20.779
 what it's believed you would actually need.

01:47:20.779 --> 01:47:25.779
 If you were to go with the largest measurements of a cubit,

01:47:25.779 --> 01:47:30.779
 this number would be almost double that.

01:47:30.779 --> 01:47:35.779
 And this would be more than two football fields.

01:47:35.779 --> 01:47:39.319
 From a sheerly mathematical perspective,

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:41.859
 at the smallest measurements,

01:47:41.859 --> 01:47:44.499
 this boat will do the job.

01:47:44.499 --> 01:47:46.639
 That's probably, bar none,

01:47:46.639 --> 01:47:51.459
 the most stable design of a vessel that you could have.

01:47:51.459 --> 01:47:56.459
 If that ship were to go almost vertical in any direction,

01:47:56.459 --> 01:47:58.339
 it would still float.

01:47:58.339 --> 01:48:03.339
 It's nearly impossible for that boat to flip.

01:48:03.339 --> 01:48:05.479
 Proportionately speaking,

01:48:05.479 --> 01:48:10.479
 it might not have gotten every animal herded onto the boat.

01:48:10.479 --> 01:48:15.479
 Anything not inside, when those doors closed,

01:48:15.479 --> 01:48:17.839
 might not be around anymore.

01:48:17.839 --> 01:48:22.839
 You ever notice that sometimes animals just know

01:48:22.839 --> 01:48:25.239
 that the storm is coming?

01:48:25.239 --> 01:48:29.339
 And more than that, where the safety is?

01:48:29.339 --> 01:48:32.299
 How do you imagine they do that?

01:48:32.299 --> 01:48:36.579
 Now we know what our ages of ancient empires were, right?

01:48:36.579 --> 01:48:40.819
 We've got the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Babylonians,

01:48:40.819 --> 01:48:43.819
 the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans,

01:48:43.819 --> 01:48:48.099
 and then some would argue we're in Rome phase two.

01:48:48.099 --> 01:48:51.579
 And these cultures, going all the way back to the beginning,

01:48:51.579 --> 01:48:56.139
 were building architecture that engineers, they marvel.

01:48:56.139 --> 01:48:58.059
 And how can this possibly be done?

01:48:58.059 --> 01:49:00.139
 Even with equipment that we have today,

01:49:00.139 --> 01:49:05.139
 the dynasties of ancient Egypt started at 2800 to 3000 BC,

01:49:05.139 --> 01:49:08.699
 where you see your first little beginnings

01:49:08.699 --> 01:49:13.699
 of the empire of Egypt at dynasty zero.

01:49:13.699 --> 01:49:15.739
 In this Egyptian king's list,

01:49:15.739 --> 01:49:19.899
 you see Seti and the young Ramses the Great

01:49:19.899 --> 01:49:22.379
 was important to these ancient cultures

01:49:22.379 --> 01:49:27.379
 to keep meticulous track of who was in charge and why.

01:49:27.379 --> 01:49:31.339
 But looking back in ancient Egyptian prehistory,

01:49:31.339 --> 01:49:36.139
 they also had a flood story in which the Egyptians

01:49:36.139 --> 01:49:39.779
 believed that they were descendants

01:49:39.779 --> 01:49:44.339
 from the man who survived the global flood

01:49:44.339 --> 01:49:48.739
 on a boat that had saved all mankind.

01:49:48.739 --> 01:49:53.739
 It is at that 3000 BC mark that we begin to see

01:49:53.739 --> 01:49:58.739
 the ancient world come to life in this area right in here.

01:49:58.739 --> 01:50:01.379
 Little settlements beginning to take shape,

01:50:01.379 --> 01:50:05.659
 the fertile crescent, Mesopotamia,

01:50:05.659 --> 01:50:08.379
 between the Tigris and Euphrates

01:50:08.379 --> 01:50:12.099
 and over here alongside the Nile Riverbank,

01:50:12.099 --> 01:50:17.099
 the first trickles, the tiny inceptions of our known history

01:50:17.099 --> 01:50:21.539
 start in that spance of land right there.

01:50:21.539 --> 01:50:23.939
 That's what they mean when you hear them say

01:50:23.939 --> 01:50:28.099
 it goes dark after 3000 BC.

01:50:28.099 --> 01:50:33.099
 Anything after that date is a big question mark.

01:50:33.099 --> 01:50:37.819
 3000 BC is not just when you see your first settlements

01:50:37.819 --> 01:50:42.259
 beginning to take shape and rise into empires.

01:50:42.259 --> 01:50:47.259
 That's also the area where the boat that saved all mankind

01:50:47.259 --> 01:50:48.939
 is said to have landed.

01:50:48.939 --> 01:50:51.299
 The legend of Yu.

01:50:51.299 --> 01:50:54.499
 After the great worldwide flood,

01:50:54.499 --> 01:50:58.259
 a man named Yu surveyed the land of China.

01:50:58.259 --> 01:51:01.139
 In the Far East, the Xia Dynasty,

01:51:01.139 --> 01:51:04.859
 the first dynasty of ancient China

01:51:04.859 --> 01:51:09.859
 started its inception at 2000 BC.

01:51:09.859 --> 01:51:14.859
 Many snakes and dragons were driven off from the marshlands.

01:51:14.859 --> 01:51:19.059
 The peoples and lands of ancient India

01:51:19.059 --> 01:51:23.619
 were divided up until the land was conquered

01:51:23.619 --> 01:51:28.619
 by Alexander the Great between the years of 327 to 325 BC.

01:51:28.619 --> 01:51:33.619
 And then at the point of Alexander's death in 323 BC,

01:51:33.619 --> 01:51:38.019
 you see the rise of the first empire of India,

01:51:38.019 --> 01:51:40.459
 the Murian Dynasty.

01:51:40.459 --> 01:51:44.779
 That brings us back to our first empire, Egypt,

01:51:44.779 --> 01:51:49.779
 the place where the first pyramids would begin to rise

01:51:49.779 --> 01:51:53.979
 at about 2600 BC.

01:51:53.979 --> 01:51:57.099
 And our oldest written king story,

01:51:57.099 --> 01:52:00.899
 the 12 Tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh,

01:52:00.899 --> 01:52:05.899
 King of Uruk, called by some the oldest city in the world.

01:52:05.899 --> 01:52:10.899
 Gilgamesh is listed in the Sumerian Kings List

01:52:10.899 --> 01:52:15.899
 as one of the first kings following the flood,

01:52:15.899 --> 01:52:20.899
 living somewhere between 2700 and 2900 BC.

01:52:20.899 --> 01:52:25.219
 From the land of Sumer in ancient Mesopotamia,

01:52:25.219 --> 01:52:29.859
 Gilgamesh took 50 men to cut down cedar trees,

01:52:29.859 --> 01:52:34.859
 and they were confronted by an ancient dinosaur dragon

01:52:34.859 --> 01:52:36.859
 that they had to conquer.

01:52:36.859 --> 01:52:40.019
 But it's after that that the story of Gilgamesh

01:52:40.019 --> 01:52:42.219
 really begins.

01:52:42.219 --> 01:52:46.339
 Gilgamesh would ultimately go on a journey

01:52:46.339 --> 01:52:51.339
 to find one of the sons of the man who had built the boat

01:52:51.339 --> 01:52:54.819
 that had saved all mankind.

01:52:54.819 --> 01:52:58.139
 Many historians believe that it was Ham

01:52:58.139 --> 01:53:02.499
 that Gilgamesh referenced in his 12 Tablets.

01:53:02.499 --> 01:53:05.539
 However, it is important to note

01:53:05.539 --> 01:53:10.539
 that the use of the term son of in the ancient world

01:53:10.539 --> 01:53:13.739
 as is used in the Epic of Gilgamesh

01:53:13.739 --> 01:53:18.459
 can also mean grandson, great-grandson,

01:53:18.459 --> 01:53:23.459
 or even great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson.

01:53:23.459 --> 01:53:25.539
 But whatever the case,

01:53:25.539 --> 01:53:29.820
 if Gilgamesh meets one of the sons of Noah

01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:31.500
 about right here,

01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:34.179
 then that means that the flood

01:53:34.179 --> 01:53:37.500
 can't be too far that direction.

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:40.899
 Commentators speculate, conjecture,

01:53:40.899 --> 01:53:45.899
 that the flood occurred at 10,000 BC,

01:53:45.899 --> 01:53:48.579
 and my question would be this.

01:53:48.579 --> 01:53:51.459
 How come from this point here

01:53:51.459 --> 01:53:56.459
 I can find cultures rising up

01:53:56.459 --> 01:54:01.459
 into at least six different empires right in here,

01:54:01.459 --> 01:54:05.500
 but on this side from here all the way back,

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:08.859
 3,000 to 10,000 BC,

01:54:08.859 --> 01:54:13.059
 that is 7,000 years,

01:54:13.059 --> 01:54:16.419
 and then all of a sudden out of the blue

01:54:16.419 --> 01:54:18.739
 from the same range of mountains

01:54:18.739 --> 01:54:21.659
 that the boat is said to have landed in,

01:54:21.659 --> 01:54:25.299
 in the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia,

01:54:25.299 --> 01:54:27.059
 and then right over here,

01:54:27.059 --> 01:54:29.299
 over to the Nile River in Egypt,

01:54:29.299 --> 01:54:34.299
 little settlements begin to pop up at 3,000 BC

01:54:34.299 --> 01:54:35.979
 is a flat line.

01:54:35.979 --> 01:54:40.179
 But if I use the original Septuagint

01:54:40.179 --> 01:54:43.379
 translated from the Hebrew Torah

01:54:43.379 --> 01:54:48.379
 to precision Greek during the third century BC

01:54:48.379 --> 01:54:52.019
 under Ptolemy after Alexander the Great,

01:54:52.019 --> 01:54:55.979
 or if you go with the original Hebrew Masoretic,

01:54:55.979 --> 01:55:00.979
 you're gonna come up with a flood date of 3,000 BC.

01:55:00.979 --> 01:55:03.659
 Maybe a touch more, but not much.

01:55:03.659 --> 01:55:06.419
 And based on our current population charts,

01:55:06.419 --> 01:55:08.939
 if you've got seven billion people

01:55:08.939 --> 01:55:13.099
 on the face of the planet in 2012 AD,

01:55:13.099 --> 01:55:16.539
 and you hop back just 2,000 years,

01:55:16.539 --> 01:55:18.539
 a year zero, the birth of Christ,

01:55:18.539 --> 01:55:20.699
 you're at 200 million people.

01:55:20.699 --> 01:55:25.699
 You've gone from 200 million bumped to seven billion people.

01:55:25.699 --> 01:55:30.459
 You hop back another 3,000 years,

01:55:30.459 --> 01:55:35.299
 it is extremely easy to arrive at eight people

01:55:35.299 --> 01:55:40.299
 on the face of the planet Earth anywhere within this range.

01:55:40.299 --> 01:55:44.519
 So was Noah's flood at 3,000 BC?

01:55:44.519 --> 01:55:47.639
 It wasn't there, you tell me.

01:55:47.639 --> 01:55:50.839
 But I know this, that it's incredibly difficult

01:55:50.839 --> 01:55:54.879
 for me to believe that seashells like this one here,

01:55:54.879 --> 01:55:58.919
 or perhaps these, slowly crept their way up to the top

01:55:58.919 --> 01:56:01.919
 of the highest mountain in the world,

01:56:01.919 --> 01:56:05.999
 Everest in the Himalayas, or worse still.

01:56:05.999 --> 01:56:11.479
 that there were guys on those mountain peaks tossing out seashells just for kicks.

01:56:11.479 --> 01:56:20.659
 In reality, there are strange things, seashells, marine life, and fish fossils found in mountain

01:56:20.659 --> 01:56:26.239
 ranges all across the amazement of the whole earth.

01:56:26.239 --> 01:56:35.599
 Speaking of fish that are out of place, 75 different kinds of full-sized whales were

01:56:35.599 --> 01:56:43.999
 found fossilized in a mass graveyard of whale fossils in the Atacama Desert, the most arid

01:56:43.999 --> 01:56:47.079
 desert in the world, in Chile.

01:56:47.079 --> 01:56:54.119
 How do you imagine 75 whales that size might end up in the middle of a desert?

01:56:54.119 --> 01:57:00.959
 Perhaps they just forgot that they weren't dogs anymore, sort of crawled out there.

01:57:00.959 --> 01:57:08.119
 No matter how you cut it, our history has got a lot of curveballs in it.

01:57:08.119 --> 01:57:17.399
 And at the center of our history, the very point right between BC, before Christ, and

01:57:17.399 --> 01:57:28.319
 AD after dead, Jesus Christ, a physical body born of no social class who would be covered

01:57:28.319 --> 01:57:36.599
 more than any king that has lived or breathed or walked on the empires of this earth.

01:57:36.599 --> 01:57:48.479
 There are at least 365 extremely specific prophecies about the coming of that child,

01:57:48.479 --> 01:57:56.719
 given from more than 20 different prophets, including Elisha, Elijah, Daniel in ancient

01:57:56.719 --> 01:58:00.159
 Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar.

01:58:00.159 --> 01:58:09.919
 Daniel, living in 600 BC, predicted the rise and fall, rise and fall of empires that would

01:58:09.919 --> 01:58:21.919
 come after his time with 100% accuracy, including the birth and early death of Alexander the

01:58:21.919 --> 01:58:29.279
 Great and the splitting of the whole empire into the lands of the four generals under

01:58:29.279 --> 01:58:32.239
 Alexander after his death.

01:58:32.239 --> 01:58:39.199
 It's not just Zechariah that predicted the Messiah would enter Jerusalem on the back

01:58:39.199 --> 01:58:49.839
 of a donkey, Daniel predicted the exact day and date, nearly 600 years before Jesus rode

01:58:49.839 --> 01:58:52.559
 that donkey through that front gate.

01:58:52.559 --> 01:59:02.079
 Isaiah, who wrote the pages and prophecies seen on this recreation of a Dead Sea Scroll,

01:59:02.079 --> 01:59:11.519
 lived in the 8th century BC, not only predicted the fall of the most powerful city in the

01:59:11.519 --> 01:59:20.319
 world, Babylon, but predicted exactly how the city would fall and the name of the man

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:22.799
 who would do it, Cyrus.

01:59:22.799 --> 01:59:31.119
 Then when Babylon fell, it was actually Daniel who walked out and handed King Cyrus a copy

01:59:31.119 --> 01:59:40.559
 of Isaiah's scrolls, written roughly 200 years beforehand, and went through and showed Cyrus

01:59:40.559 --> 01:59:49.279
 his name in that scroll, and exactly how the city was conquered, written by Isaiah

01:59:49.279 --> 01:59:57.839
 roughly 200 years earlier, in fact detailing that the city would be taken by lowering the

01:59:57.839 --> 02:00:00.239
 water and coming in.

02:00:00.239 --> 02:00:05.839
 If you were King Cyrus, it would give you a little bit of a shiver, wouldn't it?

02:00:05.839 --> 02:00:13.599
 Isaiah would go on to prophesy in Isaiah 7.14 that the Messiah would be born of a virgin,

02:00:13.599 --> 02:00:22.159
 Isaiah 9.6-7 that there would be a son called God, Isaiah 49.6 God's salvation would reach

02:00:22.159 --> 02:00:30.719
 the ends of the earth, 35.4-6 the Messiah would perform many miracles, 41-5 he would

02:00:30.719 --> 02:00:36.319
 be preceded by another prophet who would be a messenger, it would be John the Baptist,

02:00:36.319 --> 02:00:46.319
 53.1-3 he would be rejected, the Pharisees would not be happy campers about this, 53.4-6

02:00:46.319 --> 02:00:55.839
 he would die for the souls of all mankind, 53.12 he would be numbered amongst the transgressors,

02:00:55.839 --> 02:01:05.039
 53.9 that he would be buried in a rich man's tomb, this is the actual empty garden tomb

02:01:05.039 --> 02:01:10.879
 where it's believed that Jesus was buried and then resurrected.

02:01:10.879 --> 02:01:16.639
 How do you imagine these men could possibly know these things in advance?

02:01:16.639 --> 02:01:23.959
 But it's not just Isaiah from the 8th century BC or Micah who said verbatim that he would

02:01:23.959 --> 02:01:31.759
 be born in Bethlehem, or Zechariah who prophesied to the penny how much Jesus would be sold

02:01:31.759 --> 02:01:40.919
 out for 500 years in advance, that the Savior would be betrayed for exactly 30 shekels of

02:01:40.919 --> 02:01:41.919
 silver.

02:01:41.919 --> 02:01:50.119
 If I'm allowed to go outside Biblical sources, then that number of 365 precise prophecies

02:01:50.119 --> 02:01:53.199
 about Jesus Christ skyrockets.

02:01:53.199 --> 02:01:58.879
 I can even go pre-flood on prophecies of Jesus Christ.

02:01:58.879 --> 02:02:06.439
 Book of Enoch, the great grandfather of Noah, redundantly prophesied the coming of the Son

02:02:06.439 --> 02:02:14.079
 of Man, the Lord of the Sheep, the one for whom salvation would come not only for the

02:02:14.079 --> 02:02:20.879
 righteous before his coming, but all those afterwards, that through his name they shall

02:02:20.879 --> 02:02:22.079
 be saved.

02:02:22.079 --> 02:02:30.999
 And curiously enough, if I take the actual names in order from Adam all the way down

02:02:30.999 --> 02:02:39.159
 to Noah, and then I look at the root meaning of those names in Genesis in order, this is

02:02:39.159 --> 02:02:48.519
 what it reads, Man appointed mortal sorrow, the blessed God shall come down teaching.

02:02:48.519 --> 02:02:54.959
 His death shall bring the despairing rest and comfort.

02:02:54.959 --> 02:02:58.439
 Thousands would come to hear Jesus speak.

02:02:58.439 --> 02:03:03.119
 And he's not recorded as being out there selling tickets.

02:03:03.119 --> 02:03:08.799
 Not just healing some who came, but healing all who came.

02:03:08.799 --> 02:03:14.519
 On many occasions the masses wanted to make him king, but that's not what he's recorded

02:03:14.519 --> 02:03:16.999
 as having come to do.

02:03:16.999 --> 02:03:24.119
 In many, many ancient cultures of the world, kings would sacrifice their subjects to underworld

02:03:24.119 --> 02:03:30.479
 gods, spare no expense to feed darkness other people's lives.

02:03:30.479 --> 02:03:34.999
 Jesus Christ would be the complete reverse of this.

02:03:34.999 --> 02:03:38.039
 Remember I mentioned the underworld gods.

02:03:38.039 --> 02:03:46.439
 What greater love could one have than to lay down their life for their friends.

02:03:46.439 --> 02:03:49.519
 The eyes of the blind opened.

02:03:49.519 --> 02:03:56.879
 This is exactly what made men like the Pharisees behind the scenes unhappy.

02:03:56.879 --> 02:04:03.059
 Under the cover of night in the garden of Gethsemane when the high priest and his soldier

02:04:03.059 --> 02:04:10.639
 minions come in to get Jesus and Peter jumps up with the other disciples and he cuts off

02:04:10.639 --> 02:04:16.479
 the high priest's ear and Jesus stops him and says,

02:04:16.479 --> 02:04:22.999
 The cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

02:04:22.999 --> 02:04:32.639
 Then, fascinatingly, the last miracle recorded by Jesus before that cross is to put back

02:04:32.639 --> 02:04:37.159
 on the ear of his own enemy.

02:04:37.159 --> 02:04:44.879
 This is the box holding the body of the high priest that demanded that Jesus be crucified.

02:04:44.879 --> 02:04:51.159
 So I guess nobody's really confused about where he's at today.

02:04:51.159 --> 02:04:55.199
 And here's the tomb where Jesus was for three days.

02:04:55.199 --> 02:05:06.199
 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forevermore and have the keys to

02:05:06.199 --> 02:05:09.239
 death, hell, and the grave.

02:05:09.239 --> 02:05:16.739
 After being resurrected, Jesus got together with the disciples and with the people for

02:05:16.739 --> 02:05:18.799
 forty days.

02:05:18.799 --> 02:05:27.519
 From the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, Jesus ascended with a cast of heaven's hosts.

02:05:27.519 --> 02:05:35.559
 That's why he's covered much more than any king, even Alexander the Great, who conquered

02:05:35.559 --> 02:05:40.559
 90% of the known world before his death.

02:05:40.559 --> 02:05:45.160
 Nothing recorded is going on as usual.

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:52.959
 After the ascension of Jesus, as the word began to spread further and further, the Pharisees

02:05:52.959 --> 02:05:55.639
 came out with a fierce rage.

02:05:55.639 --> 02:06:03.519
 Ten of the twelve disciples would ultimately be systematically hunted out, tortured, and

02:06:03.519 --> 02:06:08.360
 crucified in horrible, torturous ways.

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:15.160
 The Pharisees told Peter, the very one who had stepped out of the boat and walked on

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:22.959
 water for merely a moment, that if he would deny Jesus, that they would let him live.

02:06:22.959 --> 02:06:33.040
 Peter declined that offer, refusing to recant one single word.

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:42.600
 But he did make a humble request, that having stood on the same ground as his savior, Jesus

02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:50.959
 Christ, that he was unworthy to be crucified in the same way as his king.

02:06:50.959 --> 02:06:58.119
 Thus, Peter would step out of this life on a cross upside down.

02:06:58.119 --> 02:07:05.439
 John was actually thrown into a boiling vat of hot oil, survived it.

02:07:05.439 --> 02:07:14.439
 Perhaps John's purpose wasn't finished yet, and ended up on the island of Patmos, where

02:07:14.439 --> 02:07:16.479
 he wrote the book of Revelation.

02:07:16.479 --> 02:07:19.079
 This would only get worse.

02:07:19.079 --> 02:07:27.319
 Religious rulers, combined with the might of empires, would relentlessly hunt out to

02:07:27.319 --> 02:07:30.999
 persecute in a unified effort.

02:07:30.999 --> 02:07:36.040
 Anyone who knew Jesus, had talked to Jesus, spoke to Jesus, walked with Jesus, knew anything

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:44.280
 about Jesus, fed them to lions for sport, hunted them out to hang, crucifixions as far

02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:51.480
 as the eye could see to strike fear in any heart that would dare utter the name Jesus.

02:07:51.480 --> 02:08:01.240
 To keep you from ever getting one yacht or tittle of those texts, they failed.

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:07.840
 Those pages were paid for with buckets of blood.

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:13.639
 But after the word spread to the farthest reaches of the globe, they did the next natural

02:08:13.639 --> 02:08:14.639
 thing.

02:08:14.639 --> 02:08:20.079
 Join them, and then go right back to business as usual.

02:08:20.079 --> 02:08:27.160
 See, as long as you've painted a really nice cross on the shield, it makes it all better.

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:33.959
 Some even going so far as to define earliest scientists' heretics, which might play a

02:08:33.959 --> 02:08:40.079
 wee role in the contentions between religion and science.

02:08:40.079 --> 02:08:42.200
 Let's take a look at the universe.

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:47.040
 You know the fascinating thing about heavenly bodies?

02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.120
 They're very precise.

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:51.280
 You could almost set your clock to them.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:54.800
 In fact, we do set our clocks to them.

02:08:54.800 --> 02:09:00.800
 Now the most predominant theorem on how all this got here is the Big Bang.

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:06.040
 One of the things it's got going for it is that we can conceptualize it, right?

02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.920
 A big Star Wars style explosion in space.

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:13.639
 But here's the fascinating thing.

02:09:13.639 --> 02:09:17.480
 It almost doesn't look like a random operation, does it?

02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:26.280
 Everything that we're able to examine of the universe is based on a 3% sample of what we

02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.680
 can see.

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:35.160
 So I've got a big Swiss watch, and I can see its parts, but I can't see the mass that's

02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:36.880
 holding it together.

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:48.880
 So our current models of the universe are based on 96 to 97% of forces and mass that

02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.720
 we can't find.

02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:58.720
 In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was stretching.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:00.359
 It's expanding.

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:06.999
 And we know by the redshifts that the universe is accelerating.

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:12.119
 Now before Hubble, there's only one other place I know of where you'll find talk about

02:10:12.119 --> 02:10:19.160
 this business of the stretching of the heavens, and that would be in the Old Testament prophets.

02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:31.280
 In fact, 17 times by my count, 17 times by guys separated by hundreds of years, all predicting

02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:33.599
 that the universe was expanding.

02:10:33.599 --> 02:10:36.840
 Those guys just seemed to guess right an awful lot.

02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:38.039
 Talk about redundancy.

02:10:38.039 --> 02:10:48.919
 In fact, Isaiah in Isaiah 40.22 managed to say that the earth was round and that the

02:10:48.919 --> 02:10:53.359
 heavens were stretching in the same sentence.

02:10:53.359 --> 02:11:01.039
 You've probably heard it said by astronomers that they were shocked when it was first discovered

02:11:01.039 --> 02:11:04.679
 that the universe was accelerating as opposed to

02:11:04.679 --> 02:11:11.399
 accelerating. That's because this is exactly the reverse of what should

02:11:11.399 --> 02:11:18.359
 happen if a big random space explosion had occurred. Shh! Don't tell anyone I

02:11:18.359 --> 02:11:25.679
 told you this. But the 73% of the dark energy that we invented at the same time

02:11:25.679 --> 02:11:31.359
 that we discovered the universe was accelerating is to fix the problem that

02:11:31.359 --> 02:11:37.999
 the 3% down here does exactly the opposite of what it should under the

02:11:37.999 --> 02:11:45.919
 Big Bang model. It is he who sits above the sphere of earth, its inhabitants like

02:11:45.919 --> 02:11:54.399
 grasshoppers, who stretches the heavens. That's 1,600 years before it was proven

02:11:54.399 --> 02:12:04.399
 that the earth was round. But are there massive unseen forces creating that

02:12:04.399 --> 02:12:12.079
 precise clicks of the Swiss watch that we call a universe? Oh indeed there are. A

02:12:12.079 --> 02:12:20.279
 lot larger and it does not appear to be a random kind of energy. It was in 1917

02:12:20.279 --> 02:12:27.719
 that Albert Einstein discovered the cosmological constant that he himself

02:12:27.719 --> 02:12:35.479
 thought the numbers couldn't be right. But as we know today it turns out he was

02:12:35.479 --> 02:12:43.919
 right. Well I mean he's Einstein. In layman's terms the finite construct of

02:12:43.919 --> 02:12:52.599
 this thing that we call a universe and all of its majestic mechanical clockwork

02:12:52.599 --> 02:13:00.959
 are fine-tuned to one part in a trillion trillion trillion. What I'm telling you

02:13:00.959 --> 02:13:09.519
 is this. The finite precision construct of the entire universe, trillion trillion

02:13:09.519 --> 02:13:18.079
 inside which is the earth, which most definitely should not be here. Trillion

02:13:18.079 --> 02:13:24.959
 trillion with the precision beings constructed of digital software, that

02:13:24.959 --> 02:13:31.559
 would be you and I with no spare mutating parts, that are consciously

02:13:31.559 --> 02:13:39.279
 self-aware comprised of cells that are more sophisticated than every factory

02:13:39.279 --> 02:13:46.079
 on the face of the earth run by biological software. The cosmological

02:13:46.079 --> 02:13:54.479
 constant, the fine-tuning precision of every piece of the universe is set to

02:13:54.479 --> 02:14:03.439
 one part in one with a hundred and twenty zeros behind it. On the other hand

02:14:03.439 --> 02:14:09.359
 this cosmological constant is tuned to one part and ten to the 120, a hundred

02:14:09.359 --> 02:14:15.799
 and twenty decimal places. Nobody thinks that's accidental. In fact it's the

02:14:15.799 --> 02:14:20.759
 cosmological constant that caused some physicists to come up with what they

02:14:20.759 --> 02:14:29.319
 call multi-universe theory, sometimes also called Elvis theory, meaning that if

02:14:29.319 --> 02:14:36.159
 you had an infinite number of universes, perhaps in one of those universes you

02:14:36.159 --> 02:14:44.559
 could have one where every single particle struck right every single time.

02:14:44.559 --> 02:14:50.719
 Trillion, you've got to really want for there to be no creator. Pretty bad for

02:14:50.719 --> 02:15:00.079
 the multi-universe theory. Trillion and one part in that entire monster of a

02:15:00.079 --> 02:15:07.079
 number. Yeah, it doesn't look random. No matter how you cut it, you're in a

02:15:07.079 --> 02:15:16.839
 finite construct. That in and of itself is powerful knowledge. Let's take a look

02:15:16.839 --> 02:15:22.519
 at the particles of that construct. Within the area of just physics alone

02:15:22.519 --> 02:15:27.839
 there is probably nothing that will more quickly shove you into the

02:15:27.839 --> 02:15:32.159
 metaphysical, the spiritual, and the dimensional than talking about that

02:15:32.159 --> 02:15:41.119
 subatomic matrix of reality. This is not a trite issue. That is the framework, the

02:15:41.119 --> 02:15:49.439
 actual particles upon which all of this sits. The paradox in every single piece

02:15:49.439 --> 02:15:57.799
 of this place. Everything. It's not just that time and space dissolve into

02:15:57.799 --> 02:16:04.919
 paradox. That's the wrong way to look at it. It's from paradox that time and space

02:16:04.919 --> 02:16:11.799
 actually become. So this is the nucleus of my atom with a cloud of superposition

02:16:11.799 --> 02:16:18.119
 of possibilities all poking up all around it. An ocean of little intelligent

02:16:18.119 --> 02:16:27.199
 dots. The three-dimensional pixels of this place. A program writing in the

02:16:27.199 --> 02:16:34.959
 material world. Reality on its finest scale can appear like a majesty of

02:16:34.959 --> 02:16:42.159
 little waves, vibrations of notes. But that can be deceptive because if one

02:16:42.159 --> 02:16:49.119
 were to dive a little bit deeper, it's actually made of little bitty dots. In

02:16:49.119 --> 02:16:57.179
 layman's terms, it's digital. It is not analog. Everything here in this place is

02:16:57.179 --> 02:17:02.139
 actually quantitized. The very frame fabric of the entire place. That's the

02:17:02.139 --> 02:17:09.259
 term quantum mechanics. It's all in little bitty digital dots appearing out

02:17:09.259 --> 02:17:16.939
 of seemingly thin space. Doing it so fast that it creates the illusion of something

02:17:16.939 --> 02:17:24.499
 solid like this microphone here. To make up the fabric of the material world. All

02:17:24.499 --> 02:17:32.739
 of it. The entire construct. The majesty which is even the finest little bitty

02:17:32.739 --> 02:17:42.579
 pieces of the biology of this material world. Here's my ongoing music sheet of

02:17:42.579 --> 02:17:49.939
 reality and here is my particle. Was Max Planck the actual father of quantum

02:17:49.939 --> 02:17:58.099
 physics who discovered Planck time. That time moves at 10 to the negative 43

02:17:58.099 --> 02:18:05.339
 seconds. This is not just the particle vibrating up and down or oscillating

02:18:05.339 --> 02:18:11.539
 back and forth. This is literally the particle actually being the notes. This

02:18:11.539 --> 02:18:16.819
 is what they mean when they say that the particle has no locality. That time and

02:18:16.819 --> 02:18:24.779
 space dissolve at that point. It's literally appearing where it needs to be

02:18:24.779 --> 02:18:32.979
 next. Matter is 10 to the negative 33 centimeters. Give or take. Beginning as

02:18:32.979 --> 02:18:38.059
 children one of the first things that we learn is that time from our perception

02:18:38.059 --> 02:18:43.499
 operates in a linear fashion. It only goes one way. You know one could almost

02:18:43.499 --> 02:18:53.499
 think that time and the particle pixels of reality itself were actually

02:18:53.499 --> 02:18:59.859
 connected. Imagine that you're watching a parade and here come the drummers and

02:18:59.859 --> 02:19:04.619
 the other instrumentalists and you're watching it one frame at a time from the

02:19:04.619 --> 02:19:10.459
 ground. Just like the particles of this place that seem to be appearing and

02:19:10.459 --> 02:19:18.259
 generated as we go along, so also is time. Correct? So time is passing. One

02:19:18.259 --> 02:19:22.619
 drummer person, one person stepping by at a time. So this is the beginning of an

02:19:22.619 --> 02:19:27.899
 event and this is the ending of an event. In fact, this could represent someone's

02:19:27.899 --> 02:19:35.379
 entire lifetime. And imagine that you came up from above the parade outside

02:19:35.379 --> 02:19:42.139
 the construct of the entire universe. So you were outside time in a helicopter

02:19:42.139 --> 02:19:47.379
 above the parade. And you could see the starting area or the staging area. Watch

02:19:47.379 --> 02:19:52.819
 the parade come around the buildings and actually see where it ends all

02:19:52.819 --> 02:19:58.299
 simultaneously. But you and I are not outside of the construct. In fact, we're

02:19:58.299 --> 02:20:02.899
 dead inside of it. You are never living in the past nor are you ever living in

02:20:02.899 --> 02:20:09.259
 the future. You are always standing on the most crucial moment. The moment that

02:20:09.259 --> 02:20:17.619
 determines everything. No matter when it is, it is always right now. Our body is

02:20:17.619 --> 02:20:23.499
 made of the same particles that the whole matrix of the place is made of.

02:20:23.499 --> 02:20:31.779
 With five little senses which we seem mysteriously plugged in to consciously

02:20:31.779 --> 02:20:39.939
 control. Allowing us to poke around and examine the place on a finer scale. One

02:20:39.939 --> 02:20:46.699
 little frame at a time. You are always standing on the razor's edge of where

02:20:46.699 --> 02:20:54.339
 reality becomes. In fact, you're helping define it. Now if the whole place is

02:20:54.339 --> 02:21:03.139
 comprised of little particle pixel guys in every square inch. Almost like a

02:21:03.139 --> 02:21:10.539
 precise data live stream. That are not random and are appearing. Trillions of

02:21:10.539 --> 02:21:18.299
 them creating even the tip of this pen precisely wherever they need to appear

02:21:18.299 --> 02:21:27.259
 next. Moving at a rate of 10 to the negative 43 seconds. Creating in sheer

02:21:27.259 --> 02:21:34.179
 unbelievable mass this thing that we call reality. But whatever's going on

02:21:34.179 --> 02:21:41.899
 here is by no means a human hard drive. Little precision particle pixels in a

02:21:41.899 --> 02:21:48.739
 pure live stream. And of course as the final touch, construct is interactive.

02:21:48.739 --> 02:21:56.379
 Like intelligent smart parts within the construct. As if not only fed by a

02:21:56.379 --> 02:22:04.739
 source but also each one being interactive. Which would indeed cause the

02:22:04.739 --> 02:22:12.179
 particles to behave in the intelligent yet strange ways that they do. Come to

02:22:12.179 --> 02:22:21.139
 think of it that would create time space and matter simultaneously. Wouldn't it?

02:22:21.139 --> 02:22:28.259
 A woman came up to me recently and she said I had a dream and in my dream the

02:22:28.259 --> 02:22:38.179
 voice of the Lord Yahweh came to me and he said for men of science who seek even

02:22:38.179 --> 02:22:48.739
 the tip of the finger of who I am I have but two words intrinsic energy but you

02:22:48.739 --> 02:22:55.219
 can call me dad if you like. I think I nearly teared up when she said that to

02:22:55.219 --> 02:23:02.979
 me. You know it's fascinating before Jesus Christ left he said in my father's

02:23:02.979 --> 02:23:12.219
 house there are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go that I

02:23:12.219 --> 02:23:21.019
 may prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also. What's amazing is

02:23:21.019 --> 02:23:28.659
 that this place even in its click click click declining state is so majestic

02:23:28.659 --> 02:23:35.420
 which leads one to wonder what lies beyond the particles of this present

02:23:35.420 --> 02:23:42.259
 illusion. So every piece of everything here is not just playing little notes

02:23:42.259 --> 02:23:51.859
 it's playing little specific notes. So let's brass tacks this out. What's behind

02:23:51.859 --> 02:24:01.259
 the veil of this present illusion? The other side of the place where reality

02:24:01.259 --> 02:24:08.420
 becomes. The only explanation which anyone could come up with is that the particles

02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:19.619
 don't just exist in our universe. They flit into existence in other universes too and there are an

02:24:19.619 --> 02:24:25.059
 infinite number of these parallel universes. We physicists now believe there are other

02:24:25.059 --> 02:24:31.379
 soap bubbles out there. There's no longer a universe. There's no longer a one world.

02:24:31.379 --> 02:24:37.420
 There are many worlds. Essentially anything that can happen does happen in one of the

02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:42.619
 alternatives which means that superimposed on top of the universe that we know of is an

02:24:42.619 --> 02:24:49.019
 alternative universe where Al Gore is president and Elvis Presley is still alive. Do you find

02:24:49.019 --> 02:24:52.979
 yourself agreeing with that concept of these multiple universes with many

02:24:52.979 --> 02:24:57.979
 different incarnations and maybe ours is one of many different types of universes?

02:24:57.979 --> 02:25:06.499
 You mean to ask me is Elvis Presley alive in a parallel universe? Yes! The answer is maybe, possibly so.

02:25:06.499 --> 02:25:18.299
 I like it. I do. But I'm biased because I like Elvis. And who am I going to be to stand in the way of that man there having his own dimension?

02:25:18.299 --> 02:25:28.179
 But, from a physics perspective of the multi-universe Elvis theory of the many

02:25:28.179 --> 02:25:34.259
 problems, there are three that come to mind fastest. Number one, with the multi-universe thing you

02:25:34.259 --> 02:25:41.179
 could not beat the dead horse into the ground faster and harder and completely

02:25:41.179 --> 02:25:48.299
 kill Occam's Razor than you do with the multi-universe thing. Occam's Razor of course stating that the

02:25:48.299 --> 02:25:53.459
 simplest answer tends to be the correct one. With the raw data, you're living in the

02:25:53.459 --> 02:25:58.859
 hours where you've got the raw data in your hands to actually look at these

02:25:58.859 --> 02:26:03.579
 particles. Number two, of course, would be the sheer mathematics.

02:26:03.579 --> 02:26:10.859
 nightmare, horror show of putting together that particular construct. You

02:26:10.859 --> 02:26:14.659
 need a new universe. If you're intellectually honest you need a new

02:26:14.659 --> 02:26:19.339
 universe. Under the multi-universe theory every time a particle flips this means

02:26:19.339 --> 02:26:23.619
 you need infinities of infinities of infinities of infinities of headaches

02:26:23.619 --> 02:26:30.699
 more infinities of universes and writing it all out on paper. And finally number

02:26:30.699 --> 02:26:35.139
 three last one that I'll give on that even if you went through all of the

02:26:35.139 --> 02:26:43.699
 mental acrobatics they're required to come up with the multi-universe theory

02:26:43.699 --> 02:26:54.179
 it still doesn't make time space or matter but I still really really like it

02:26:54.179 --> 02:27:01.699
 because it's got Elvis it how could I not like it good work guys let's take a

02:27:01.699 --> 02:27:07.379
 look at another one only conscious beings can be observers then we're

02:27:07.379 --> 02:27:12.219
 intimately hooked in to the very existence of reality without us there

02:27:12.219 --> 02:27:17.259
 would just be this expanding superposition of possibilities with

02:27:17.259 --> 02:27:22.179
 nothing definite ever actually happening if you want to see fear in a quantum

02:27:22.179 --> 02:27:26.899
 physicists eyes just mentioned the words the measurement problem the

02:27:26.899 --> 02:27:32.499
 measurement problem is this an atom only appears in a particular place if you

02:27:32.499 --> 02:27:38.539
 measure it in other words an atom is spread out all over the place until a

02:27:38.539 --> 02:27:43.699
 conscious observer decides to look at it so the act of measurements or

02:27:43.699 --> 02:27:51.019
 observation creates the entire universe I like this one I really do a lot for a

02:27:51.019 --> 02:27:57.379
 number of reasons but I might suggest this if the consciousness does not

02:27:57.379 --> 02:28:06.099
 create the particle or the material world the consciousness is a prerequisite

02:28:06.099 --> 02:28:13.259
 for doing the measurement at all they're two entirely separate issues the

02:28:13.259 --> 02:28:20.619
 consciousness and the particle you're actually looking at the very fabric the

02:28:20.619 --> 02:28:30.259
 place where reality becomes when you're doing your measurement you're looking at

02:28:30.259 --> 02:28:40.379
 the first point where the particle is available for measurement so if I'm

02:28:40.379 --> 02:28:47.419
 understanding some of our current conjectures properly in the beginning

02:28:47.419 --> 02:28:55.339
 there was nothing nothing exploded and became sheer precision everything the

02:28:55.339 --> 02:29:03.259
 rocks began spitting out digital coding the dogs became whales the monkeys

02:29:03.259 --> 02:29:09.699
 turned into people and as the final touch it's actually Elvis on the other

02:29:09.699 --> 02:29:19.099
 side of reality I find myself strangely hesitant to commit to all that perhaps

02:29:19.099 --> 02:29:29.699
 finding myself in more agreement with Max Planck the actual founder of quantum

02:29:29.699 --> 02:29:39.979
 mechanics itself who said and I quote all matter originates and exists only by

02:29:39.979 --> 02:29:47.419
 virtue of a force which brings the particle of the atom to vibration and

02:29:47.419 --> 02:29:56.299
 holds this most minute solar system of the atom together we must assume that

02:29:56.299 --> 02:30:05.099
 behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind this mind

02:30:05.099 --> 02:30:15.059
 is the matrix of all matter that was Max Planck the actual father of quantum

02:30:15.059 --> 02:30:23.259
 physics itself now in the ancient world they were talking about dimensions but

02:30:23.259 --> 02:30:29.299
 they were not drawing Elvis in fact they were drawing strange things in the

02:30:29.299 --> 02:30:37.259
 skies as well as biological creatures anomalies that puzzle us things that

02:30:37.259 --> 02:30:43.299
 they said could step right out of thin air which is interesting because they

02:30:43.299 --> 02:30:50.859
 were building architecture to their gods that baffles us even to this very day

02:30:50.859 --> 02:30:57.699
 I'm not finding on their walls where they're talking about their gods coming

02:30:57.699 --> 02:31:05.099
 from other planets they are redundantly talking about strange physical and

02:31:05.099 --> 02:31:15.699
 spiritual beings as well as strange things that seem to occupy the skies

02:31:15.699 --> 02:31:23.179
 some of it able to pull tricks that seem to defy even the laws of physics

02:31:23.179 --> 02:31:33.019
 and deeper still things claim to step through momentarily not dissimilar to

02:31:33.019 --> 02:31:40.819
 claims even right now today disturbing claims within the arenas of psychology

02:31:40.819 --> 02:31:47.819
 claimed alien abductions things said to literally pop up not from space but

02:31:47.819 --> 02:31:56.259
 right inside people's bedrooms shadow people body paralysis serpent snake

02:31:56.259 --> 02:32:05.419
 reptilian creatures not dissimilar to the wisdom serpents throughout not just

02:32:05.419 --> 02:32:12.379
 Egypt but the entirety of the ancient world Anunnaki the biblical sons of

02:32:12.379 --> 02:32:20.499
 Anak or also called the Nephilim both before and after the flood as is

02:32:20.499 --> 02:32:25.779
 recorded by the Sumerian texts you know when I think about it there are a lot of

02:32:25.779 --> 02:32:32.539
 things in the ancient world that have this sort of reptile cold-blooded twist

02:32:32.539 --> 02:32:40.539
 serpent sort of a strange animal for a king to get his wisdom from don't you

02:32:40.539 --> 02:32:47.259
 think and if one were to go from the lights that appear in the sky down

02:32:47.259 --> 02:32:54.939
 through the fringe level stuff and then delve into the furthest regions of the

02:32:54.939 --> 02:33:02.299
 occult the accounts only become more discomforting they believe that the

02:33:02.299 --> 02:33:08.859
 tentacles of things that might be as close as the air between your fingers as

02:33:08.859 --> 02:33:16.379
 you reach out into empty space and they built the largest temples on earth to

02:33:16.379 --> 02:33:22.619
 things they believe dwelled in a dark realm in fact I would venture to guess

02:33:22.619 --> 02:33:28.659
 that there are those right on the other side of this camera who have had

02:33:28.659 --> 02:33:38.059
 experiences both light and dark that they might not share with everyone but

02:33:38.059 --> 02:33:43.779
 when thinking about just things that seem to appear in the sky boy that's a

02:33:43.779 --> 02:33:48.739
 lot of little dots out there isn't it then if the same type of activity is

02:33:48.739 --> 02:33:56.459
 recorded from the very earliest parts of time all the way to present day one

02:33:56.459 --> 02:34:04.259
 might almost think that the phenomenon was I don't know localized well if they

02:34:04.259 --> 02:34:08.059
 were coming from other planets you would think we would sense the traffic and on

02:34:08.059 --> 02:34:14.019
 top of that if you've got something that just steps right out into reality or

02:34:14.019 --> 02:34:20.419
 just appears in the skies the question really does become where is it when you

02:34:20.419 --> 02:34:26.179
 don't see it in fact they were quite specific about where their gods came

02:34:26.179 --> 02:34:32.019
 from not just in Egypt not just in Babylon cultures all across this globe

02:34:32.019 --> 02:34:43.899
 believe that their gods were in the underworld hell shield Hades Tardis the

02:34:43.899 --> 02:34:51.659
 world of serpents in fact the beginning of many a king's reign began with the

02:34:51.659 --> 02:35:00.739
 invocation ceremony the actual calling in from the underworld that the Pharaoh

02:35:00.739 --> 02:35:08.099
 would invite the embodiment of the spirit of an underworld God to

02:35:08.099 --> 02:35:17.779
 consciously rule from below through the mind and body of the Pharaoh himself on

02:35:17.779 --> 02:35:25.099
 the empires above and it's not just the ancient world John D the head

02:35:25.099 --> 02:35:31.619
 intelligence officer under Queen Elizabeth the first did intense occult

02:35:31.619 --> 02:35:38.299
 rituals and ceremonies with the full funding and backing of the Empire

02:35:38.299 --> 02:35:47.499
 literally cataloging entire hierarchies of entities some of which looked exactly

02:35:47.499 --> 02:35:55.059
 like what we may define today as an alien the official statement of the

02:35:55.059 --> 02:36:05.299
 Empire was that D was gaining wisdom from angels course after John D's death

02:36:05.299 --> 02:36:13.579
 his diary told a different story repeatedly saying I believe they're

02:36:13.579 --> 02:36:22.379
 lying to me these things are not angels they're demons that was John D I'm

02:36:22.379 --> 02:36:29.459
 quoting an occultist from present-day who stated and I quote if one were to

02:36:29.459 --> 02:36:37.419
 peer into their world by portal of spirit you could easily perceive it as

02:36:37.419 --> 02:36:44.499
 nothing less than a madness of monsters insects crawling over each other for

02:36:44.499 --> 02:36:53.739
 merely a breath be not deceived these things are highly sophisticated acting

02:36:53.739 --> 02:37:02.059
 out their fantasies through the minds of men it is by this mechanism that an

02:37:02.059 --> 02:37:11.299
 invisible enemy systematically rules all flesh its best weapon being a single

02:37:11.299 --> 02:37:19.140
 fact that most don't even understand that the patient predator behind the

02:37:19.140 --> 02:37:28.179
 mask even exists and when you're dealing with the occult this side of the flood

02:37:28.179 --> 02:37:38.419
 all roads seem to lead to the ancient Empire of Babylon rising up at the

02:37:38.419 --> 02:37:47.979
 inception of our earliest empires in Samaria and down here in Egypt where the

02:37:47.979 --> 02:37:54.779
 wisdom serpents would begin whispering in the ears of Kings now when the first

02:37:54.779 --> 02:38:02.819
 name of the God is underworld doesn't that tend to mean that the God is

02:38:02.819 --> 02:38:08.459
 already beneath you things that have already found their way into the

02:38:08.459 --> 02:38:16.099
 recycle bin of reality perhaps the drainage canal for stuff that tends to

02:38:16.099 --> 02:38:25.739
 bite the hand that feeds was Jesus Christ who said hell was never made for

02:38:25.739 --> 02:38:32.059
 mankind I wouldn't have it any other way than to end this video with the words of

02:38:32.059 --> 02:38:42.899
 John chapter 3 was when Nicodemus a wealthy Pharisee came to see Jesus under

02:38:42.899 --> 02:38:49.859
 the cover of night so that no one would see and he asked how may one gain

02:38:49.859 --> 02:38:59.700
 eternal life and Jesus replied are you not teacher of all Israel and yet you

02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:07.579
 do not know these simple things does the wind not blow where it wishes and

02:39:07.579 --> 02:39:16.219
 you neither see where it comes or to where it goes yet you know it's there I

02:39:16.219 --> 02:39:26.219
 tell you so also are those who are born of spirit so do not marvel when I say

02:39:26.219 --> 02:39:38.059
 you must be born again now in the Greek born again means born from above or more

02:39:38.059 --> 02:39:49.019
 precisely born from the place where this place comes from

02:39:49.019 --> 02:39:55.339

02:39:55.339 --> 02:40:01.939

02:40:34.099 --> 02:40:37.979

02:41:15.679 --> 02:41:23.159
 Also, I am the author of Thieves, One Dirty TV Pastor and the Man Who Robbed Him.

02:41:23.159 --> 02:41:32.099
 In 1999, I did, embarrassingly enough, commit a safe robbery on a television pastor named

02:41:32.099 --> 02:41:33.099
 Mike Murdoch.

02:41:33.099 --> 02:41:41.379
 I grew up with his son, horribly embarrassing story for me, thrill ride for you.

02:41:41.379 --> 02:41:42.619
 Take a second to check that out.

02:41:42.619 --> 02:41:52.619
 You can find that on GodInANutshell.com or go over to ReadThieves.com, ReadThieves.com.

02:41:52.619 --> 02:41:54.259
 Here's an article about the book.

02:41:54.259 --> 02:42:01.979
 There's an image of me right there that was drawn by D Magazine, one of the largest magazines

02:42:01.979 --> 02:42:02.979
 in Dallas, Texas.

02:42:02.979 --> 02:42:03.979
 Maybe the largest.

02:42:03.979 --> 02:42:07.179
 You can see there, and Mike Murdoch looks sort of angry.

02:42:07.179 --> 02:42:10.539
 There's me running with a safe from Mike Murdoch.

02:42:10.539 --> 02:42:15.979
 So, if you're curious about that story or what all went down and how that could have

02:42:15.979 --> 02:42:19.259
 possibly occurred, you're in luck.

02:42:19.259 --> 02:42:20.259
 Here's a clip.

02:42:20.259 --> 02:42:22.179
 Thieves by Trey Smith.

02:42:22.179 --> 02:42:25.539
 Amazon, Barnes and Noble, anywhere books are sold.

02:42:25.539 --> 02:42:29.259
 I've been on radio and TV for 20 years.

02:42:29.259 --> 02:42:34.419
 And Trey, first, as far as the book itself, I'll give you an example.

02:42:34.419 --> 02:42:41.019
 My producer, Will Duffy, his wife, Danielle, was in the hospital to give birth.

02:42:41.019 --> 02:42:46.259
 And they had some time, so Will is reading aloud Thieves.

02:42:46.259 --> 02:42:54.579
 And not only his wife becomes addicted to it, but people in neighboring beds, neighboring

02:42:54.579 --> 02:42:58.819
 rooms, all sat in to listen to Thieves being read.

02:42:58.819 --> 02:43:04.979
 It's like Danielle wanted to delay labor because she was so fascinated.

02:43:04.979 --> 02:43:10.099
 Thieves was me pouring literally my heart out, day after day.

02:43:10.099 --> 02:43:13.019
 These were all written in a jail cell.

02:43:13.019 --> 02:43:15.579
 And guards used to pay me when they were on shift.

02:43:15.579 --> 02:43:19.259
 They would give me extra lunch trays to read them this book.

02:43:19.259 --> 02:43:24.339
 So Thieves was originally paid for with jailhouse lunch trays.

02:43:24.339 --> 02:43:29.699
 And then, after the safe robbery, when I'm on the run from a television pastor in Mexico,

02:43:29.699 --> 02:43:32.619
 it really kicks into high octane.

02:43:32.619 --> 02:43:40.259
 Sometimes I would just stop and say to myself, there's not a lot of really great ways for

02:43:40.259 --> 02:43:42.259
 any of this to end.

02:43:42.259 --> 02:43:46.259
 Crazy as it seems though, it did all end well.

02:43:46.259 --> 02:43:49.259
 I promise.

02:43:49.259 --> 02:43:51.259
 Thank God for that.

02:43:51.259 --> 02:43:58.259
 I'm pretty certain that you're not going to find anything like this anywhere.

02:43:58.259 --> 02:44:04.899
 I wanted to tack a note on to the end of this video and state to you that that book Thieves

02:44:04.899 --> 02:44:12.539
 from start to finish, no matter how fun it might be to read, does not in any way represent

02:44:12.539 --> 02:44:14.019
 who I am today.

02:44:14.019 --> 02:44:21.379
 And more than that, I've not only asked forgiveness in my own heart, but from a great many parties

02:44:21.379 --> 02:44:28.139
 who are in that book and who are not in that book that I needed to ask for forgiveness

02:44:28.139 --> 02:44:31.059
 from.

02:44:31.059 --> 02:44:35.339
 More than that, I'd like to give a special thank you to ministries, men and women of

02:44:35.339 --> 02:44:40.899
 faith, churches and organizations all across this United States, because they are not represented.

02:44:40.899 --> 02:44:46.419
 The hearts of the people are not represented by the few that are just take, take, take,

02:44:46.419 --> 02:44:47.419
 take, take.

02:44:47.419 --> 02:44:53.539
 I have seen so many, both great and small ministries, who no matter who they are, they

02:44:53.539 --> 02:44:54.979
 would give you the last shirt off.
