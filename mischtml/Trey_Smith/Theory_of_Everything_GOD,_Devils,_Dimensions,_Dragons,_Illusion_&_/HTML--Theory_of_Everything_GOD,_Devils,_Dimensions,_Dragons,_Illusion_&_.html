To dimensions and all that which lies between, from the cells to the stars to the quantum particles making up the whole, oh yes, we're going a lot deeper on this one. From angels to fallen angels to demons to devils to even the claimed dragons of ages past, to mankind's origin itself. Buckle your seatbelts. Welcome to the theory of everything.

            <p>The three greatest mysteries since the very beginning of science have been time, space and matter. The origin of one should explain the origin of all three. The Rubik's Cube puzzle of science. The Holy Grail. Let's take a crack at it right at the start of this video. The material world is comprised of the very fabric of the material world made of an atomic world.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>All of it from the air that you breathe to the earth that you're standing on to the planets. The illusion of reality and the stars above are all made of an atomic world. Beginning in the 1920s, the era of Einstein, Max Planck and these other guys, they ran into a serious problem. You dive right beneath that, which is comprised of a subatomic world, a subatomic matrix.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And you're in your subatomic world, the place where the numbers go absolutely haywire. When they tried to pinpoint the exact location of subatomic particles, they found that it was utterly impossible. It's in fact at that point that you run into the scary measurement problem that we're going to talk about.

            <p>Then you would think, if you dug all the way down to the center, that little nucleus guy right there that's floating loose, maybe he would be solid. Nope, same thing. Little dots all poking around so fast and boom, the spot where the paradox began. Statistical probabilities to make the illusion of the material world.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So let's recap this thing, just to get a grip on what we're dealing with here. The quantum worlds are literally the framework of this entire place, the thing that we call reality itself. The foundation that actually makes up every single science of this place.
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>So we're in an enormous black abyss of space on a little blue rock of hyper-intensified life and order. In the ancient book of Hebrews, it actually states a very fascinating thing. In the 11th chapter, the 3rd verse, it says, For we know by faith that it was with words of God that the worlds were formed, that what is seen is made from that which is unseen.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Another translation of words is vibrations. As men speak words of sound that go a matter of feet and last only a couple of seconds. Perhaps God himself speaks substance. So is reality totally internalized into the little bitty universe that we live in? Or is the scope of things a little bit larger than that?

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Wasn't it Albert Einstein who said, those of us that believe in physics understand that reality is nothing more than a stubbornly persistent illusion? If that's true, then one might ask, where's the illusion coming from?
        <br/><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>

        </div>
        

  
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>To answer that question, I'd like to begin by taking a look at this little blue rock. The current conjectures in most all of science, the most predominant ones at this point, is that the entire place, including the universe right down to the earth, right down to the cells in your skin, the DNA strands and even the fabric in those quantum worlds is all a product of sheer absolute randomness.

Each of those factories has tons and tons of parts that are all working together, doing these little precision jobs, but they're not doing these jobs on their own. These factories need sets of instructions, they need software. All of the parts of the cell are not randomly doing jobs. They're doing it based on digital coding, which is giving instructions to all of the machines. So the machines not only have to be designed to work with the software, but the software has to be designed to give instructions to the machines.

Before we can go larger in scope and look at the full scale of what we're dealing with, I'd like to take a peek at evolution, which states that all of this that we've just discussed came out of sheer randomness. This is important because these are two entirely different paths. One, the evolution, we just keep getting lucky, lot-to-lot win after lotto win. But bottom line, random accidents keep mysteriously hitting lotto wins, and it's all internalized. What you see is what you get?

            <p>You've probably heard it said that horses—or animals like horses—wanted to reach tree branches way up high so over time horses grew longer and longer necks so they could get at those taller branches eventually becoming giraffes. The truth is that the genetic coding for a giraffe and its biological systems are not even remotely close to those systems found in any type of horse.

What's interesting is that the word darkness is a very, very heavy metaphor word. You know I'm wondering if the text is referring to just regular darkness or if it's referencing something a little deeper than that. And the word waters or celestial waters in every ancient culture meant the entirety of the universe, the place where the stars are.

Despite entropy, biogenesis and all of Mendel's laws of genetics, and also ignoring all of these basic day-to-day observable sciences, one would anticipate that the evidence for all of these transitions, which would have to occur, spitting out mutant animals and creatures in every conceivable direction should be readily available and easy to find within the fossil record.

Jeffrey Schwartz, in his book "Sudden Origin," stated, and I quote, "Given that evolution, according to Darwin, was in a continual state of motion, it follows logically that the fossil record should be rife with examples of transitional fossils leading from less to more evolved."

So despite just what Charles Darwin said in his own day—that there is no evidence of species changing from one to another—and the fossil record working to further illustrate that animals stay within their spectrums not seeming to have fossils that change into one another.

            <p>Now it is true that since the early 1900s—almost a hundred years now—we've been doing fruit fly experiments. Tens of thousands probably millions of generations of fruit flies at this point have been bred in labs and they do all sorts of weird stuff to them to try and encourage mutations. They're trying to get them to have a mutation that has a genetic benefit as well as pass it on. Basically they're trying to prove evolution. At this point with tens of thousands of these that have occurred, the statement that arises from the fruit fly experiments is that they appear to be immune to evolution.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And they use the fruit flies because they have short lifespans—about 11 days. On top of that, the flies are really inexpensive—they're cheap. In fact, was it not Morris Corry who said out of our 400 mutations there's not one that can be called a new species? Or Norman Macbeth who quoted if 1,000 mutations were combined all into one specimen we still would not have a new species.

Or perhaps you may prefer Francis Hitching—hardcore atheist mind you—who stated and I quote "Fruit flies refuse to become anything other than fruit flies under any circumstances yet devised." He's battery charged by the mitochondria.

Flies which produce a new generation every 11 days yet they have never seen the emergence of even as much as a new enzyme." And these guys here are little bitty turbines which are turning and they're powering billions of little mitochondria batteries.

And it's not just the fruit flies that they've been trying this mutation thing on mind you.

But the inside of those cells are made of little bitty machines all doing things so that you and I can even exist at all. Was Dr. Doug Axe and Dr. Ann Goger that came up with these numbers here. Assuming you started with your complete cell, your complete earth, and you've got your digital software running inside the cell, now you need coordinated mutations, coordinated accidents to occur within these strands on the DNA. So to get six coordinated mutations to produce one new beneficial function on the inside of a single cell would take 16 billion years. Sixteen billion years is the currently believed age of the entire universe. I didn't like their numbers so I kicked it way up. Why not? The one trillion coordinated mutations, that would be almost enough for one earthworm. Give or take. On this planet, which shouldn’t mathematically be here.

The scientific world is still reeling from the discovery of actual Tyrannosaurus Rex cells and soft tissue unearthed last week at a Montana excavation site.

It's just doesn’t seem possible, but yes you can actually take the vessels and they do have internal components and so you can take a probe and kind of squeeze those things out into solution and the vessels are fine.

Look at this first silver fox here. Now look at this silver fox, as well as these cute little silver fox variations produced within the 50-year ongoing Russian silver fox experiments. This is commonly termed as microevolution, meaning that the species can work with preexisting code within their animal kinds, which is grandly different than Darwinian evolution where things are becoming other creatures and transforming. These animals are restricted within their animal kinds. Bottom line, this fox can have other variations of foxes, but its genetic coding does not contain the information to turn into a whale.

            <p>Actually, genetically speaking, everything on this planet is losing genetic information. This is particularly observable in viruses, but in all the creatures on the planet, we're actually degrading, just like with entropy, and losing species counts. The current numbers on extinction rate are anywhere between 1,000 species a year to 10,000 between all of these types of creatures, and depending on whose numbers that you listen to, but we're certainly losing things and not gaining them. And the same applies to our genetic coding.

She would need 8,000 genera—actual couples or 8,000 family kinds—to produce the spectrums of creatures that we see on this planet right now today. That number makes provision for the extinction rate as well as, interestingly enough, he packed in all of the dinosaurs into that figure.

            <p>By the way, so I went with the smallest measurements of the interior of the boat for Noah's Ark, but now we're gonna take that a step further. Scratch out those numbers of 8,000 times them by almost four, kick it up to 30,000 kinds crammed into the boat. That vessel on the screen right there could hold the equivalent of 522 full-size railroad boxcars. In layman's terms, that would be 125,000 full-size sheep. Most of these animal kinds, which again I bumped the number way up on, are nowhere close to the size of a full-sized sheep. It's a lot of boat. How many times does 30,000 go into 125,000? And 30,000 is four times what it's believed you would actually need.

            <p>If you were to go with the largest measurements of a cubit, this number would be almost double that. And this would be more than two football fields. From a sheerly mathematical perspective, at the smallest measurements, this boat will do the job. That's probably, bar none, the most stable design of a vessel that you could have. If that ship were to go almost vertical in any direction, it would still float. It's nearly impossible for that boat to flip.

But looking back in ancient Egyptian prehistory they also had a flood story in which the Egyptians believed that they were descendants from the man who survived the global flood on a boat that had saved all mankind.

There are at least 365 extremely specific prophecies about the coming of that child, given from more than 20 different prophets, including Elisha, Elijah, and Daniel in ancient Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel, living in 600 BC, predicted the rise and fall, rise and fall of empires that would come after his time with 100% accuracy, including the birth and early death of Alexander the Great and the splitting of the whole empire into the lands of the four generals under Alexander after his death.

Isaiah, who wrote the pages and prophecies seen on this recreation of a Dead Sea Scroll, lived in the 8th century BC, not only predicted the fall of the most powerful city in the world, Babylon, but predicted exactly how the city would fall and the name of the man who would do it, Cyrus. Then when Babylon fell, it was actually Daniel who walked out and handed King Cyrus a copy of Isaiah's scrolls, written roughly 200 years beforehand, and went through and showed Cyrus his name in that scroll, and exactly how the city was conquered, written by Isaiah roughly 200 years earlier, in fact detailing that the city would be taken by lowering the water and coming in.

If I'm allowed to go outside Biblical sources, then that number of 365 precise prophecies about Jesus Christ skyrockets. I can even go pre-flood on prophecies of Jesus Christ. Book of Enoch, the great grandfather of Noah, redundantly prophesied the coming of the Son of Man, the Lord of the Sheep, the one for whom salvation would come not only for the righteous before his coming but all those afterwards, that through his name they shall be saved.

His death shall bring the despairing rest and comfort. Thousands would come to hear Jesus speak. And he's not recorded as being out there selling tickets. Not just healing some who came but healing all who came. On many occasions, the masses wanted to make him king but that's not what he's recorded as having come to do.

Jesus Christ would be the complete reverse of this. Remember I mentioned the underworld gods? What greater love could one have than to lay down their life for their friends? The eyes of the blind opened. This is exactly what made men like the Pharisees behind the scenes unhappy. Under the cover of night in the garden of Gethsemane when the high priest and his soldier minions came in to get Jesus and Peter jumped up with other disciples and cut off the high priest's ear. Jesus stops him and says," The cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"

And here's the tomb where Jesus was for three days. I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forevermore and have the keys to death, hell, and the grave.

            <p>Let's take a look at the particles of that construct. Within the area of just physics alone there is probably nothing that will more quickly shove you into the metaphysical, the spiritual, and the dimensional than talking about that subatomic matrix of reality. This is not a trite issue. That is the framework, the actual particles upon which all of this sits. The paradox in every single piece of this place. Everything.

A program writing in the material world. Reality on its finest scale can appear like a majesty of little waves, vibrations of notes. But that can be deceptive because if one were to dive a little bit deeper, it's actually made of little bitty dots.

            <p>Only conscious beings can be observers. Then we're intimately hooked in to the very existence of reality. Without us, there would just be this expanding superposition of possibilities with nothing definite ever actually happening. If you want to see fear in a quantum physicist's eyes, just mention the words "the measurement problem." The measurement problem is this: an atom only appears in a particular place if you measure it. In other words, an atom is spread out all over the place until a conscious observer decides to look at it. So the act of measurement or observation creates the entire universe.

            <p>I like this one, I really do a lot for a number of reasons, but I might suggest this: if consciousness does not create the particle, or the material world, the consciousness is a prerequisite for doing the measurement at all. They're two entirely separate issues: the consciousness and the particle you're actually looking at. The very fabric, the place where reality becomes when you're doing your measurement, you're looking at the first point where the particle is available for measurement.

            <p>So if I'm understanding some of our current conjectures properly: in the beginning, there was nothing; nothing exploded and became sheer precision everything. The rocks began spitting out digital coding, the dogs became whales, the monkeys turned into people, and as the final touch it's actually Elvis on the other side of reality. I find myself strangely hesitant to commit to all that.

We must assume that behind this force, the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter." That was Max Planck, the actual father of quantum physics itself.

            <p>Also, I am the author of Thieves, One Dirty TV Pastor and the Man Who Robbed Him. In 1999, I did, embarrassingly enough, commit a safe robbery on a television pastor named Mike Murdoch. I grew up with his son, horribly embarrassing story for me, thrill ride for you. Take a second to check that out. You can find that on GodInANutshell.com or go over to ReadThieves.com, ReadThieves.com. Here's an article about the book. There's an image of me right there that was drawn by D Magazine, one of the largest magazines in Dallas, Texas. Maybe the largest. You can see there, and Mike Murdoch looks sort of angry. There's me running with a safe from Mike Murdoch.

            <p>So, if you're curious about that story or what all went down and how that could have possibly occurred, you're in luck. Here's a clip. Thieves by Trey Smith. Amazon, Barnes and Noble, anywhere books are sold. I've been on radio and TV for 20 years. And Trey, first, as far as the book itself, I'll give you an example. My producer, Will Duffy, his wife, Danielle, was in the hospital to give birth. And they had some time, so Will is reading aloud Thieves. And not only his wife becomes addicted to it, but people in neighboring beds, neighboring rooms, all sat in to listen to Thieves being read. It's like Danielle wanted to delay labor because she was so fascinated.

            <p>Thieves was me pouring literally my heart out, day after day. These were all written in a jail cell. And guards used to pay me when they were on shift. They would give me extra lunch trays to read them this book. So Thieves was originally paid for with jailhouse lunch trays. And then, after the safe robbery, when I'm on the run from a television pastor in Mexico, it really kicks into high octane. Sometimes I would just stop and say to myself, there's not a lot of really great ways for any of this to end. Crazy as it seems though, it did all end well. I promise. Thank God for that.

I wanted to tack a note on to the end of this video and state to you that that book Thieves from start to finish, no matter how fun it might be to read, does not in any way represent who I am today. And more than that, I've not only asked forgiveness in my own heart, but from a great many parties who are in that book and who are not in that book that I needed to ask for forgiveness from.
