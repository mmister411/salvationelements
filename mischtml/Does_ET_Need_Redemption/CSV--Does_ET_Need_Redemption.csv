0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.500,3.5," This is where I want to go, because I'm amazed, I'm just frankly amazed,"
1,00:00:03.500,00:00:08.600,5.100000381469727, that everybody I've seen write on this subject acts like Romans chapter 8 doesn't exist.
2,00:00:08.600,00:00:12.319,3.719999313354492, Romans chapter 8 and Colossians chapter 1 answers this question.
3,00:00:12.319,00:00:16.200,3.8800010681152344," And it's like, could someone please quote the Bible if we're talking about it?"
4,00:00:16.200,00:00:18.800,2.6000003814697266," Now at this point, you might be wondering, okay,"
5,00:00:18.800,00:00:22.300,3.5," if God created other life forms in the universe, would he love them?"
6,00:00:22.300,00:00:25.200,2.9000015258789062, Would they be fallen? Could they do evil?
7,00:00:25.200,00:00:28.500,3.299999237060547," If so, would God redeem them? Would he take them to heaven?"
8,00:00:28.500,00:00:31.300,2.799999237060547, Would he offer them a way of salvation?
9,00:00:31.300,00:00:35.000,3.700000762939453," In Christian language, would Christ's death also be for their sin,"
10,00:00:35.000,00:00:38.600,3.5999984741210938," or would he have to be incarnated and die an ad infinitum number of times,"
11,00:00:38.600,00:00:41.600,3.0, like Thomas Paine was ridiculing?
12,00:00:41.600,00:00:43.399,1.7999992370605469, And that brings up the third issue of concern.
13,00:00:43.399,00:00:46.000,2.6000022888183594, A lot of people are worried that the notion of intelligent alien life
14,00:00:46.000,00:00:50.200,4.200000762939453, undoes the doctrines of the incarnation of Christ and redemption.
15,00:00:50.200,00:00:54.000,3.799999237060547," This is the way C.S. Lewis, a famous Christian author, put this."
16,00:00:54.000,00:00:59.000,5.000003814697266," He said, if the universe is teeming with life, again, he's just stating the position."
17,00:00:59.000,00:01:04.000,5.0," This, we are told, reduces to absurdity the Christian claim that to this one planet,"
18,00:01:04.000,00:01:08.200,4.1999969482421875, God came down and was incarnate for us and our salvation.
19,00:01:08.200,00:01:10.500,2.3000030517578125," Paul Davies puts it this way,"
20,00:01:10.500,00:01:14.800,4.299995422363281," of all the world's major religions, Christianity is the most species specific."
21,00:01:14.800,00:01:17.300,2.5, Jesus Christ was humanity's savior and redeemer.
22,00:01:17.300,00:01:20.100,2.8000030517578125," He did not die for the dolphins or the gorillas,"
23,00:01:20.100,00:01:23.200,3.0999984741210938, and certainly not for the proverbial little green men.
24,00:01:23.200,00:01:25.200,2.0, But what of deeply spiritual aliens?
25,00:01:25.200,00:01:26.500,1.3000030517578125, Are they not to be saved?
26,00:01:26.500,00:01:30.899,4.399993896484375, Are we to contemplate a universe that contains perhaps a trillion worlds of saintly beings
27,00:01:30.899,00:01:35.200,4.3000030517578125, in which the only beings eligible for salvation are the really bad ones on Earth?
28,00:01:35.200,00:01:37.500,2.3000030517578125, This is how Davies framed the question.
29,00:01:37.500,00:01:42.000,4.5," Catholics and others see where this is going about this multiple incarnation thing,"
30,00:01:42.000,00:01:43.700,1.6999969482421875, and that's what spooks them.
31,00:01:43.700,00:01:47.100,3.4000015258789062," Now, this alleged problem proceeds along a number of assumptions,"
32,00:01:47.100,00:01:49.100,2.0, all of which I believe are flawed.
33,00:01:49.100,00:01:52.500,3.4000015258789062," In Christian theology, all humans need to be redeemed"
34,00:01:52.500,00:01:56.700,4.1999969482421875, to have their moral guilt before a holy God erased and forgiven.
35,00:01:56.700,00:01:59.600,2.9000015258789062, The mechanism for this is the sacrificial death of Christ
36,00:01:59.600,00:02:02.599,2.9999923706054688, on behalf of all humanity and his resurrection.
37,00:02:02.599,00:02:04.399,1.8000030517578125," Salvation cannot be merited,"
38,00:02:04.399,00:02:07.599,3.1999969482421875," but is imparted to all those who put their faith in what Jesus did,"
39,00:02:07.599,00:02:09.300,1.70001220703125, that this is the gospel.
40,00:02:09.300,00:02:14.200,4.899993896484375," As such, Davies' comments in particular show a fundamental misunderstanding of the gospel,"
41,00:02:14.200,00:02:15.000,0.8000030517578125, for one thing.
42,00:02:15.000,00:02:16.100,1.100006103515625," But be that as it may,"
43,00:02:16.100,00:02:20.300,4.1999969482421875, the assumption that E.T. needs a savior would have to be based on the prior assumption
44,00:02:20.300,00:02:23.000,2.6999969482421875, that E.T. was guilty before God.
45,00:02:23.000,00:02:28.300,5.3000030517578125," The guilt would in turn have to be incurred when and if E.T. failed a moral test,"
46,00:02:28.300,00:02:31.800,3.5, like the one put to Adam and Eve in an event called the Fall.
47,00:02:31.800,00:02:33.300,1.5," Now, some thoughts for you."
48,00:02:33.300,00:02:37.500,4.1999969482421875, The fact that E.T. is intelligent has nothing to do with his need of salvation.
49,00:02:37.500,00:02:41.800,4.3000030517578125," Adam and Eve were intelligent creatures, but did not need salvation until they sinned."
50,00:02:41.800,00:02:45.900,4.100006103515625, E.T. would only need salvation if there was a fall for E.T.
51,00:02:45.900,00:02:48.300,2.399993896484375, The Bible teaches that every human bears guilt before God.
52,00:02:48.300,00:02:52.800,4.5," Since E.T. is not human, he is exempt without a fall."
53,00:02:52.800,00:02:54.600,1.8000030517578125, E.T. would not need a savior.
54,00:02:54.600,00:02:56.900,2.3000030517578125, And so that makes the question moot.
55,00:02:56.900,00:02:59.200,2.3000030517578125, I would like to say it makes the question silly.
56,00:02:59.200,00:03:01.600,2.399993896484375," But nevertheless, it was a serious question within the church."
57,00:03:01.600,00:03:04.900,3.3000030517578125, Why would we assume God would test the E.T.'s he created?
58,00:03:04.900,00:03:06.600,1.6999969482421875," He might, but this is not required."
59,00:03:06.600,00:03:09.500,2.899993896484375, And God would not be forced to do this because he did it on Earth.
60,00:03:09.500,00:03:13.900,4.4000091552734375," Even if he did not test E.T. and E.T. was unfallen, the whole problem is moot."
61,00:03:13.900,00:03:17.300,3.399993896484375, The fact that E.T. was a created being and God's grand creative output
62,00:03:17.300,00:03:20.000,2.6999969482421875, also does not mean that salvation is necessary.
63,00:03:20.000,00:03:24.500,4.5," Animals don't need to be saved, yet they are part of the new heaven and the new Earth at the time of the end."
64,00:03:24.500,00:03:26.700,2.20001220703125," Angels are also intelligent created beings,"
65,00:03:26.700,00:03:30.200,3.5, and they are not included in the plan of salvation according to the Bible.
66,00:03:30.200,00:03:34.200,4.0," If there are aliens, they may also have been excluded from the plan of salvation."
67,00:03:34.200,00:03:39.100,4.899993896484375," One would not need to conclude from this that they, like fallen angels, would be eternally punished."
68,00:03:39.100,00:03:41.300,2.1999969482421875, They might just die and that's it.
69,00:03:41.300,00:03:43.500,2.1999969482421875," On the other hand, and this is where I want to go,"
70,00:03:43.500,00:03:48.300,4.8000030517578125," because I'm amazed, I'm just frankly amazed that everybody I've seen write on this subject"
71,00:03:48.300,00:03:51.400,3.100006103515625, acts like Romans chapter 8 doesn't exist.
72,00:03:51.400,00:03:55.200,3.8000030517578125, Romans chapter 8 and Colossians chapter 1 answers this question.
73,00:03:55.200,00:03:59.200,4.0," And it's like, could someone please quote the Bible if we're talking about it?"
74,00:03:59.200,00:04:04.500,5.29998779296875," E.T.'s, on the other hand, would be included under the atonement of Christ,"
75,00:04:04.500,00:04:07.000,2.5, but not in a spiritual salvation sense.
76,00:04:07.000,00:04:08.000,1.0, Here's how they would be included.
77,00:04:08.000,00:04:12.000,4.0," They would be included with everything else in the created world, the created cosmos."
78,00:04:12.000,00:04:14.000,2.0," Romans 8, now listen to this as I read."
79,00:04:14.000,00:04:15.300,1.300018310546875," Paul says,"
80,00:04:15.300,00:04:15.800,0.5, Catch this.
81,00:04:15.800,00:04:17.800,2.0," Paul says,"
82,00:04:17.800,00:04:19.300,1.5, And it's by God's design.
83,00:04:19.300,00:04:20.800,1.5, Just read you Colossians 1.
84,00:04:20.800,00:04:24.300,3.5, Same idea. I'm amazed that it's like nobody knows these passages are there.
85,00:04:24.300,00:04:26.300,2.0," Colossians 1, Paul writing again,"
86,00:04:26.300,00:04:31.800,5.5, But one of the reasons that God came up with the plan of the incarnation of redemption
87,00:04:31.800,00:04:39.800,8.0," was so that the entire cosmos, which He through Christ created, could be saved and redeemed."
88,00:04:39.800,00:04:45.800,6.0," The only way you are not in that group is if you retain deliberately by your own choice,"
89,00:04:45.800,00:04:47.300,1.5, your moral guilt before God.
90,00:04:47.300,00:04:50.800,3.5," If you've never had moral guilt before God, if you've never fallen,"
91,00:04:50.800,00:04:56.800,6.0," And again, if ET's out there and there's no fall out there on another planet, he's in."
92,00:04:56.800,00:04:59.800,3.0, This is a totally irrelevant question.
93,00:04:59.800,00:05:03.800,4.0, And I don't know why it has plagued the church for so long.
