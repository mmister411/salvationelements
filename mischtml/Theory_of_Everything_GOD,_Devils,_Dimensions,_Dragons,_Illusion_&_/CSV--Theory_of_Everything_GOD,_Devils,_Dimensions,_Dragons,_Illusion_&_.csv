1,00:00:11.600,00:00:18.899,7.299999237060547," Everything from God to heaven to hell to time to space, when you hear the science guys talking"
2,00:00:18.899,00:00:27.719,8.819999694824219," about the theory of everything, we're not talking about the same thing."

7,00:00:57.439,00:00:59.240,1.8000030517578125, Buckle your seatbelts.
8,00:00:59.240,00:01:02.200,2.9599990844726562, Welcome to the theory of everything.
9,00:01:02.200,00:01:13.320,11.120002746582031," Now to really dig into this, you've got to start with the understanding that it's not"
10,00:01:13.320,00:01:14.960,1.6399993896484375, just the universe.
11,00:01:14.960,00:01:17.840,2.8799972534179688, It's like this enormous Swiss watch.
12,00:01:17.840,00:01:26.280,8.44000244140625," The living organisms in this place are literally made of digital codes, of mechanics that we"
13,00:01:26.280,00:01:31.719,5.439994812011719, really don't understand even the tip of the iceberg of.
14,00:01:31.719,00:01:40.880,9.160003662109375," These are actual zip files, DNA strands to basically open like hyper-intensified life"
15,00:01:40.880,00:01:48.599,7.719993591308594, running all over the place to create every single life form on this planet.
16,00:01:48.599,00:01:49.599,1.0, It's bigger than that.
17,00:01:49.599,00:01:52.519,2.9199981689453125, Let me put this in perspective for you.
18,00:01:52.519,00:01:59.080,6.5600128173828125," Everything from the fish and the plankton in the sea to the air that you breathe in,"
19,00:01:59.080,00:02:05.560,6.4799957275390625, the oxygen from the trees to the carbon dioxide that you feed them back and return to the
20,00:02:05.560,00:02:09.000,3.44000244140625, land animals that crawl on the ground.
21,00:02:09.000,00:02:15.640,6.6399993896484375, You and I right now while you're watching this video on the other side of the screen
22,00:02:15.640,00:02:25.200,9.55999755859375, are on a little bitty blue rock that it's all also symbiotic in an enormous black abyss
23,00:02:25.200,00:02:27.840,2.6399993896484375, called space.
24,00:02:27.840,00:02:35.720,7.8800048828125, Everything here is connected to everything else almost like a cradle that's for the infants.
25,00:02:35.720,00:02:40.239,4.519989013671875, This is not just a few things work together here and there.
26,00:02:40.239,00:02:49.119,8.8800048828125, This is sheer precision in every little piece of every part of this place.
27,00:02:49.119,00:02:52.879,3.7599945068359375, Systems built on systems built on systems.
28,00:02:52.879,00:03:03.319,10.44000244140625," Genesis means the point of origin, the beginning, the inception, where what was not becomes"
29,00:03:03.319,00:03:04.319,1.0, what is.
30,00:03:04.319,00:03:11.519,7.1999969482421875, It even has its own little force field ozone to keep the atmosphere in.
31,00:03:11.519,00:03:13.559,2.0399932861328125, All making a whole.
32,00:03:13.559,00:03:18.839,5.279998779296875, It is all connected from the cells to the stars.
33,00:03:18.839,00:03:20.439,1.600006103515625, Isn't that awesome?
34,00:03:20.439,00:03:25.319,4.8800048828125, Look how thin that is beyond imagination.
35,00:03:25.319,00:03:27.359,2.0399932861328125, They're sure glad that thing's there.
36,00:03:27.359,00:03:33.679,6.32000732421875," The three greatest mysteries since the very beginning of science have been time, space"
37,00:03:33.679,00:03:34.679,1.0, and matter.
38,00:03:34.679,00:03:39.759,5.0800018310546875, The origin of one should explain the origin of all three.
39,00:03:39.759,00:03:44.119,4.3600006103515625, The Rubik's Cube puzzle of science.
40,00:03:44.119,00:03:47.159,3.0399932861328125, The Holy Grail.
41,00:03:47.159,00:03:50.919,3.7599945068359375, Let's take a crack at it right at the start of this video.
42,00:03:50.919,00:03:57.440,6.52001953125, The material world is comprised of the very fabric of the material world made of an atomic
43,00:03:57.440,00:03:58.440,1.0, world.
44,00:03:58.440,00:04:02.720,4.279998779296875, All of it from the air that you breathe to the earth that you're standing on to the planets.
45,00:04:02.720,00:04:10.039,7.319976806640625, The illusion of reality and the stars above are all made of an atomic world.
46,00:04:10.039,00:04:16.239,6.20001220703125," Beginning in the 1920s, the era of Einstein, Max Planck and these other guys, they ran"
47,00:04:16.239,00:04:19.440,3.20001220703125, into a serious problem.
48,00:04:19.440,00:04:26.399,6.959991455078125," You dive right beneath that, which is comprised of a subatomic world, a subatomic matrix."
49,00:04:26.399,00:04:32.399,6.0," And you're in your subatomic world, the place where the numbers go absolutely haywire."
50,00:04:32.399,00:04:39.959,7.55999755859375," When they tried to pinpoint the exact location of subatomic particles, they found that it"
51,00:04:39.959,00:04:42.879,2.91998291015625, was utterly impossible.
52,00:04:42.879,00:04:48.639,5.760009765625, It's in fact at that point that you run into the scary measurement problem that we're going
53,00:04:48.639,00:04:49.639,1.0, to talk about.
54,00:04:49.639,00:04:54.199,4.55999755859375," Then you would think, if you dug all the way down to the center, that little nucleus guy"
55,00:04:54.199,00:04:57.639,3.44000244140625," right there that's floating loose, maybe he would be solid."
56,00:04:57.639,00:04:59.759,2.1199951171875," Nope, same thing."
57,00:04:59.759,00:05:07.239,7.480010986328125," Little dots all poking around so fast and boom, the spot where the paradox began."
58,00:05:07.239,00:05:13.959,6.720001220703125, Statistical probabilities to make the illusion of the material world.
59,00:05:13.959,00:05:18.220,4.260009765625," So let's recap this thing, just to get a grip on what we're dealing with here."
60,00:05:18.220,00:05:25.799,7.579986572265625," The quantum worlds are literally the framework of this entire place, the thing that we call"
61,00:05:25.799,00:05:28.440,2.6400146484375, reality itself.
62,00:05:28.440,00:05:36.119,7.67999267578125, The foundation that actually makes up every single science of this place.
63,00:05:36.119,00:05:45.039,8.91998291015625, So we're in an enormous black abyss of space on a little blue rock of hyper-intensified
64,00:05:45.039,00:05:46.599,1.55999755859375, life and order.
65,00:05:46.599,00:05:52.919,6.32000732421875," In the ancient book of Hebrews, it actually states a very fascinating thing."
66,00:05:52.919,00:05:57.119,4.20001220703125," In the 11th chapter, the 3rd verse, it says,"
67,00:05:57.119,00:06:06.879,9.759979248046875," For we know by faith that it was with words of God that the worlds were formed, that what"
68,00:06:06.879,00:06:13.039,6.160003662109375, is seen is made from that which is unseen.
69,00:06:13.039,00:06:18.440,5.4000244140625, Another translation of words is vibrations.
70,00:06:18.440,00:06:26.879,8.439971923828125, As men speak words of sound that go a matter of feet and last only a couple of seconds.
71,00:06:26.879,00:06:32.319,5.44000244140625, Perhaps God himself speaks substance.
72,00:06:32.319,00:06:38.319,6.0, So is reality totally internalized into the little bitty universe that we live in?
73,00:06:38.319,00:06:46.159,7.839996337890625, Or is the scope of things a little bit larger than that?
74,00:06:46.159,00:06:53.019,6.860015869140625," Wasn't it Albert Einstein who said, those of us that believe in physics understand that"
75,00:06:53.019,00:07:01.299,8.279998779296875, reality is nothing more than a stubbornly persistent illusion?
76,00:07:01.299,00:07:09.099,7.79998779296875," If that's true, then one might ask, where's the illusion coming from?"
77,00:07:09.099,00:07:17.099,8.0," To answer that question, I'd like to begin by taking a look at this little blue rock."
78,00:07:17.099,00:07:23.219,6.1199951171875," The current conjectures in most all of science, the most predominant ones at this point, is"
79,00:07:23.219,00:07:27.579,4.3599853515625," that the entire place, including the universe right down to the earth, right down to the"
80,00:07:27.579,00:07:32.619,5.040008544921875," cells in your skin, the DNA strands and even the fabric in those quantum worlds is all"
81,00:07:32.619,00:07:36.579,3.959991455078125, a product of sheer absolute randomness.
82,00:07:36.579,00:07:40.539,3.959991455078125, I'd like to take a peek at that.
83,00:07:40.539,00:07:47.459,6.920013427734375," So if you and I are the amazingly intelligent fish within an enormous fishbowl, I guess"
84,00:07:47.459,00:07:53.819,6.360015869140625," my first couple of questions would be, how did the fishbowl get there and how did we"
85,00:07:53.819,00:07:56.059,2.239990234375, get inside of it?
86,00:07:56.059,00:08:02.099,6.040008544921875," In mathematics, anything that is 10 to the 50th power to 1 is considered impossible."
87,00:08:02.099,00:08:04.659,2.55999755859375, It would be an absolute miracle.
88,00:08:04.659,00:08:11.259,6.5999755859375," Just to give you a train of reference for that, 10 to the 82nd power is how many atoms"
89,00:08:11.259,00:08:13.139,1.880035400390625, are believed to be in the entire universe.
90,00:08:13.139,00:08:22.579,9.44000244140625, Now it was Roger Penrose that came up with this number here for the odds of a universe
91,00:08:22.579,00:08:27.939,5.3599853515625, that would produce one planet that could sustain life like the earth.
92,00:08:27.939,00:08:33.639,5.70001220703125," So if that didn't bother you the first time, let me run it by you one more time again."
93,00:08:33.639,00:08:36.279,2.63995361328125," Another impossibility, another impossibility, another impossibility."
94,00:08:36.279,00:08:38.719,2.44000244140625, So let me tell you what this means.
95,00:08:38.719,00:08:45.039,6.32000732421875," Right now, while you're watching this video, by any mathematical construct, possibility,"
96,00:08:45.039,00:08:50.999,5.96002197265625," another impossibility, another impossibility, another impossibility, you and I are sandwiched"
97,00:08:50.999,00:08:57.919,6.91998291015625, right dead in the center of a place that should not exist.
98,00:08:57.919,00:08:59.959,2.0400390625, And that's just where we start.
99,00:08:59.959,00:09:08.899,8.93994140625, And everything in the universe works together as a perfect precision of order to allow the
100,00:09:08.899,00:09:11.419,2.52001953125, existence of this little blue rock.
101,00:09:11.419,00:09:20.919,9.5, And everything on this little blue rock are symbiotic relationships to allow us to exist.
102,00:09:20.919,00:09:23.439,2.52001953125, Everything here is symbiotic.
103,00:09:23.439,00:09:28.719,5.27996826171875, It is all systems that are intimately dependent on other systems.
104,00:09:28.719,00:09:35.739,7.02001953125, So this is a protein manufacturing line within inside the cell.
105,00:09:35.739,00:09:43.719,7.97998046875, Like sometimes the key to exactly what you've been looking for is right in front of you.
106,00:09:43.719,00:09:48.199,4.48004150390625, If you take a second to look at it.
107,00:09:48.199,00:09:51.919,3.719970703125, This is not just a few examples here and there.
108,00:09:51.919,00:09:58.719,6.79998779296875," Basically everything in this place is connected, no matter how loosely, to every other thing"
109,00:09:58.719,00:09:59.719,1.0, in this place.
110,00:09:59.719,00:10:05.999,6.280029296875," From the food chains, and the underwater worlds, the land animals that roam on the ground,"
111,00:10:05.999,00:10:12.559,6.55999755859375, to the very cells and the skin and the fabric of this entire place.
112,00:10:12.559,00:10:18.439,5.8800048828125," To get a DNA strand, you have to have the proteins configured properly."
113,00:10:18.439,00:10:23.160,4.72003173828125," But to get the proteins, you've got to have the DNA strand."
114,00:10:23.160,00:10:25.840,2.67999267578125, There is no chicken before the egg.
115,00:10:25.840,00:10:29.079,3.239990234375, And that's just one example of this.
116,00:10:29.079,00:10:35.239,6.15997314453125," Many would argue that the entire place, the construct of the universe, right down to the"
117,00:10:35.239,00:10:42.879,7.6400146484375," earth, to the molecular fabric of your skin, is irreducibly complex from bottom to top."
118,00:10:42.879,00:10:49.079,6.20001220703125," So entropy, one of the laws of thermodynamics, is that things deteriorate."
119,00:10:49.079,00:10:51.840,2.760009765625, They decline over time.
120,00:10:51.840,00:10:53.259,1.41998291015625, It's not really complex.
121,00:10:53.259,00:11:01.759,8.5, We observe this on a day-to-day basis that organized things tend to deteriorate to chaos
122,00:11:01.759,00:11:03.439,1.67999267578125, over time.
123,00:11:03.439,00:11:04.840,1.4000244140625, They don't seem to improve.
124,00:11:04.840,00:11:11.679,6.8399658203125," Now with humans, we engineer stuff and we try and tug-of-war and fight with entropy"
125,00:11:11.679,00:11:17.639,5.9599609375," and build better things, but ultimately, systems decline."
126,00:11:17.639,00:11:23.759,6.12005615234375," Our construct, our physical bodies, are made not only just of the particles, which we'll"
127,00:11:23.759,00:11:31.279,7.51995849609375," touch on and get into in just a second, but those particles, those little precision units"
128,00:11:31.279,00:11:37.999,6.72003173828125," of information, which is what Einstein would have called them, those little digits are"
129,00:11:37.999,00:11:43.239,5.239990234375," making up the cells, which are as complex as cities."
130,00:11:43.239,00:11:50.199,6.9599609375," We're going to carry it to the nucleus of the cell, which is going to open up and let"
131,00:11:50.199,00:11:58.359,8.1600341796875," the RNA carry this DNA, RNA delivery system into the heart of the cell."
132,00:11:58.359,00:12:05.679,7.32000732421875," Have you ever noticed that sometimes to understand the larger scope of something, you've got"
133,00:12:05.679,00:12:08.959,3.27996826171875, to actually go surgical for a minute.
134,00:12:08.959,00:12:12.359,3.4000244140625, Get your hands right in the mix.
135,00:12:12.359,00:12:16.759,4.4000244140625, Pay attention to its smallest parts for just a minute.
136,00:12:16.759,00:12:23.679,6.91998291015625," Here, imagine winning the lottery every single day, not missing once."
137,00:12:23.679,00:12:30.599,6.91998291015625," For the next 10,000 years, you would still be nowhere close to that number."
138,00:12:30.599,00:12:42.799,12.20001220703125," The odds of one single cell, just one little cell guy, are 10 to the 39,970 to 1, give or take."
139,00:12:42.799,00:12:48.279,5.47998046875," Now in comparison to that last number, this one looks really small, right?"
140,00:12:48.279,00:12:55.119,6.84002685546875," And in mathematics, we know that anything that is 10 to the 50th power to 1 is a mathematical"
141,00:12:55.119,00:12:56.119,1.0, impossibility.
142,00:12:56.119,00:13:02.999,6.8800048828125, There are 10 to the 82nd power atoms believed to be in the entire universe.
143,00:13:02.999,00:13:08.639,5.63995361328125, So how many times does this number fit into that number above?
144,00:13:08.639,00:13:15.479,6.84002685546875," The answer is this, trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions, and this number"
145,00:13:15.479,00:13:21.559,6.08001708984375," could keep on going for a long, long ways."
146,00:13:21.559,00:13:32.039,10.47998046875, There's the number of atoms in the universe to 1 against there being one single cell in
147,00:13:32.039,00:13:33.039,1.0, this place.
148,00:13:33.039,00:13:36.919,3.8800048828125," I went with the low ball numbers on that, by the way."
149,00:13:36.919,00:13:45.199,8.27996826171875," Now the inside of a cell is a living, breathing, high performance, no nonsense, no joke factory."
150,00:13:45.199,00:13:52.039,6.8399658203125," There's my DNA strand inside the heart of the cell, and these little machine guys come"
151,00:13:52.039,00:13:56.319,4.280029296875, through here in a process called transcription.
152,00:13:56.319,00:13:59.119,2.79998779296875, These things are the size of cities.
153,00:13:59.119,00:14:06.159,7.03997802734375," In fact, the inner world of this cell is larger in its inner world than New York City with"
154,00:14:06.159,00:14:12.199,6.0400390625, all of its little parts doing very specific precision jobs.
155,00:14:12.199,00:14:16.079,3.8800048828125," Then this next set of machines come through, and they're writing, and they're actually"
156,00:14:16.079,00:14:22.479,6.4000244140625," doing copying, which, of course, like any factory, it all fits together like a perfect"

158,00:14:23.479,00:14:27.159,3.67999267578125, It doesn't have spare factory parts in there.
159,00:14:27.159,00:14:34.759,7.5999755859375, Every little piece is serving a precision role to every other part within the inside
160,00:14:34.759,00:14:39.199,4.44000244140625," of that cell, which would mean, of course, that at its inception, it has..."
161,00:14:39.199,00:14:43.839,4.639999866485596," to starve as a complete piece, otherwise it wouldn't exist at all."
162,00:14:43.839,00:14:51.839,8.000000476837158," In fact, if you took every piece of technology that we have ever made, packed it into a space"
163,00:14:51.839,00:14:58.919,7.079998970031738," so small that you could barely see it with our largest microscopes, you would still be"
164,00:14:58.919,00:15:08.199,9.280000686645508, light years away from the technology employed in a single cell of this place.
165,00:15:08.199,00:15:13.319,5.119998931884766," And that single cell guy, he's dependent on other things that are beating the exact"

167,00:15:16.719,00:15:21.839,5.119998931884766," See, he's dependent on things, and those things are dependent on things."
168,00:15:21.839,00:15:27.279,5.44000244140625," Single cell is not just dependent on all of its internal parts, but it's dependent on"
169,00:15:27.279,00:15:29.959,2.6799964904785156, the external world as well.
170,00:15:29.959,00:15:38.839,8.880001068115234," Other things beating the same type of numbers, as if simultaneously, so that all of the parts"
171,00:15:38.839,00:15:44.999,6.160003662109375," can function, accident after accident after accident after accident, and those things"
172,00:15:44.999,00:15:49.159,4.159996032714844," are dependent on things, and those things dependent on things, and those things things"

174,00:15:56.079,00:15:59.959,3.8800048828125," odds just like these, for them to exist at all."
175,00:15:59.959,00:16:02.399,2.4399948120117188, Let me put this in perspective for you.
176,00:16:02.399,00:16:10.959,8.560005187988281," Imagine you were that single cell, and you had just beat absolute mathematical insanity,"
177,00:16:10.959,00:16:13.679,2.720001220703125, and here you come into existence.
178,00:16:13.679,00:16:20.519,6.839996337890625," But immediately you die, because all of the other stuff that you're dependent on, it's"
179,00:16:20.519,00:16:22.879,2.3600006103515625, not in place.
180,00:16:22.879,00:16:28.039,5.159996032714844," Just like the accidents were, I don't know, coordinated?"
181,00:16:28.039,00:16:36.759,8.720001220703125, Every living biological organism on this planet is constructed of little bitty factories.
182,00:16:36.759,00:16:46.919,10.160003662109375, These precision factories are all doing sophisticated operations within the entirety of the cell.
183,00:16:46.919,00:16:53.359,6.44000244140625," Each of those factories has tons and tons of parts that are all working together, doing"
184,00:16:53.359,00:16:59.839,6.4799957275390625," these little precision jobs, but they're not doing these jobs on their own."
185,00:16:59.839,00:17:05.279,5.44000244140625," These factories need sets of instructions, they need software."
186,00:17:05.279,00:17:10.559,5.279998779296875, All of the parts of the cell are not randomly doing jobs.
187,00:17:10.559,00:17:17.319,6.7599945068359375," They're doing it based on digital coding, which is giving instructions to all of the"
188,00:17:17.319,00:17:18.759,1.44000244140625, machines.
189,00:17:18.759,00:17:24.999,6.2400054931640625," So the machines not only have to be designed to work with the software, but the software"
190,00:17:24.999,00:17:30.099,5.0999908447265625, has to be designed to give instructions to the machines.
191,00:17:30.099,00:17:35.159,5.0600128173828125," So when you hear the scientists marveling, saying, how can this happen on its own?"
192,00:17:35.159,00:17:37.239,2.079986572265625, Why are the numbers this bad?
193,00:17:37.239,00:17:45.399,8.160003662109375," The mathematical miracles happening all over the place, that's why the numbers are that"
194,00:17:45.399,00:17:46.399,1.0, bad.
195,00:17:46.399,00:17:58.159,11.760009765625," At some point on the timeline, order does have to occur, because we're here, right?"
196,00:17:58.159,00:18:05.359,7.1999969482421875," Then it's about to get more intense, because the digital coding in your cellular factories"
197,00:18:05.359,00:18:09.719,4.3600006103515625, is about to have to coordinate and come together.
198,00:18:09.719,00:18:17.359,7.6399993896484375, That gets you one single cell in all of the factory parts that are moving inside that
199,00:18:17.359,00:18:24.719,7.3600006103515625, cell and the little digital DNA software running the cell guy on top of the earth that shouldn't
200,00:18:24.719,00:18:29.079,4.3600006103515625," be there, in the universe that came out of nowhere."
201,00:18:29.079,00:18:36.279,7.1999969482421875," But this, right here, is the point where the accidents have to go sheer precision."
202,00:18:36.279,00:18:39.439,3.160003662109375," That's a human heart right there, surgical."
203,00:18:39.439,00:18:44.559,5.1199951171875, These accidents have got to be shoved violently into hyperdrive.
204,00:18:44.559,00:18:47.479,2.9199981689453125, Millions and millions and millions and millions.
205,00:18:47.479,00:18:51.799,4.32000732421875, That is a very sophisticated piece of machinery.
206,00:18:51.799,00:18:58.759,6.959991455078125, You do not want the digital instructions that are all coming together to create that guy.
207,00:18:58.759,00:19:03.119,4.360015869140625," You cannot have trial and error, a little bit off this way, a little bit off that way"
208,00:19:03.119,00:19:06.999,3.8800048828125," would be a bad, bad thing."
209,00:19:06.999,00:19:15.519,8.519989013671875, Have got to come together and coordinate of digital code all funneled into a pure live

211,00:19:16.519,00:19:26.239,9.720001220703125," Now all of the digital mastery has got to come together as one complete, creating everything"
212,00:19:26.239,00:19:32.239,6.0," from the bones being written in, to the muscles, to the ear, is where the rabbit hole goes"
213,00:19:32.239,00:19:33.919,1.67999267578125, really deep.
214,00:19:33.919,00:19:37.719,3.79998779296875, The part where you need the master file.
215,00:19:37.719,00:19:45.599,7.8800048828125, You need body plans which will coordinate all of that software to become that pulls
216,00:19:45.599,00:19:51.679,6.08001708984375," all of it together into one majesty, a body plan."
217,00:19:51.679,00:19:57.439,5.759979248046875, Putting together everything from the fingertips to the tongue to the toes and every part in
218,00:19:57.439,00:20:05.559,8.120025634765625," between and mind you, you need a body plan not just for the human beings but a separate"
219,00:20:05.559,00:20:17.799,12.239990234375, set of living instructions for every living breathing species type and kind of organism
220,00:20:17.799,00:20:19.799,2.0, on this planet.
221,00:20:19.799,00:20:25.479,5.67999267578125, And this digital code has got to be a lot more complex than any of our stuff.
222,00:20:25.479,00:20:33.079,7.600006103515625, It has to be three dimensional and configured properly because it's making three dimensional
223,00:20:33.079,00:20:37.519,4.44000244140625, biological organisms from scratch.
224,00:20:37.519,00:20:45.879,8.3599853515625," Not only are there no spare parts, not just on human beings but on any other species of"

226,00:20:48.479,00:20:51.719,3.240020751953125, They're all a precision completeness.
227,00:20:51.719,00:20:58.399,6.67999267578125," But more than that, unlike machines that we make like computers and things of that type,"
228,00:20:58.399,00:21:03.839,5.44000244140625, it can do redundant error correction to make sure that this comes out right.
229,00:21:03.839,00:21:10.519,6.67999267578125," And unlike clunky machines made by man, it can self-heal like cranes and such that with"
230,00:21:10.519,00:21:16.399,5.8800048828125, time the part will wear out in the construct of the human condition.
231,00:21:16.399,00:21:21.519,5.1199951171875, The muscles are actually designed to strengthen with use.
232,00:21:21.519,00:21:26.719,5.20001220703125, A literal mastery of biological hardware.
233,00:21:26.719,00:21:31.959,5.239990234375," But it's not complete until, boom, you got your consciousness."
234,00:21:31.959,00:21:34.039,2.079986572265625, Never forget the cherry on top.
235,00:21:34.039,00:21:36.319,2.279998779296875, Right on top of all of it.
236,00:21:36.319,00:21:39.319,3.0," Sort of like being plugged into wifi, huh?"
237,00:21:39.319,00:21:44.959,5.6400146484375, The real you and neurons and little connections coming down the spinal cord.
238,00:21:44.959,00:21:50.319,5.3599853515625, It's almost like there's something larger going on here than mortgage payments and car
239,00:21:50.319,00:21:51.319,1.0, notes.
240,00:21:51.319,00:21:53.239,1.920013427734375," Look, here's the paradox."
241,00:21:53.239,00:21:54.959,1.720001220703125, Let me lay it out for you.
242,00:21:54.959,00:22:00.639,5.67999267578125, You can see the hyper-intensified order all inside.
243,00:22:00.639,00:22:04.759,4.1199951171875, Every little detail of the place.
244,00:22:04.759,00:22:11.759,7.0, But you cannot see the source from which that order comes.
245,00:22:11.759,00:22:16.839,5.079986572265625, Even if it's dimensionally layered right on top of it.
246,00:22:16.839,00:22:18.719,1.8800048828125, We'll get to that.
247,00:22:18.719,00:22:25.279,6.55999755859375, The very spot within the life sciences where the matrix of all the little bitty fabric
248,00:22:25.279,00:22:31.919,6.6400146484375, of machines and cells and parts that have come together to make the beautiful construction
249,00:22:31.919,00:22:40.799,8.8800048828125, of these biological machines within the matrix of this place gets smack dab hit with the
250,00:22:40.799,00:22:42.279,1.480010986328125, neurosciences.
251,00:22:42.279,00:22:51.279,9.0," There is no point within those two sciences alone where you're going to run into the metaphysical,"
252,00:22:51.279,00:22:58.759,7.480010986328125," the dimensional, and the spiritual faster than that point to give all of these precise"
253,00:22:58.759,00:23:03.879,5.1199951171875, directions to the parts right at the moments that you think about them.
254,00:23:03.879,00:23:07.039,3.160003662109375, Some kind of a point of translation.
255,00:23:07.039,00:23:12.439,5.39996337890625, There's got to be a little bit more going on in there than just little electrical connections.
256,00:23:12.439,00:23:20.359,7.9200439453125, In both the Greek and Hebrew texts it refers to the human body as a temple that are zipping
257,00:23:20.359,00:23:22.159,1.79998779296875, this way and that.
258,00:23:22.159,00:23:25.799,3.6400146484375," Not in any random fashion, mind you."
259,00:23:25.799,00:23:34.039,8.239990234375," The ghost in the machine, the actual intangible conscious being that makes up what you call"
260,00:23:34.039,00:23:41.399,7.3599853515625, you operating through a physical apparatus of the human body.
261,00:23:41.399,00:23:45.159,3.760009765625, The intangible controlling the tangible.
262,00:23:45.159,00:23:51.759,6.5999755859375, The very spot where some might argue two dimensions meet.
263,00:23:51.759,00:23:59.039,7.280029296875, Right here in Genesis 127 it does say that God created man in his own image.
264,00:23:59.039,00:24:01.959,2.91998291015625, It's a bold statement.
265,00:24:01.959,00:24:12.639,10.67999267578125, 97% of your entire body is all self-functioning from the organs to the cells to every single
266,00:24:12.639,00:24:16.959,4.32000732421875, part of your biological machinery.
267,00:24:16.959,00:24:22.919,5.96002197265625, But you're calling the top shots experiencing the natural world through five senses.
268,00:24:22.919,00:24:25.999,3.08001708984375, This is not a trite piece of business.
269,00:24:25.999,00:24:34.639,8.63995361328125, Every second you are taking hold and driving the whole machine by the reins.
270,00:24:34.639,00:24:40.939,6.29998779296875, It's everything from moving the arms to where you're going to walk to your favorite flavor
271,00:24:40.939,00:24:42.679,1.74005126953125, of ice cream.
272,00:24:42.679,00:24:49.799,7.1199951171875, How does something as material as the matter of the mind ever give rise to something as
273,00:24:49.799,00:24:59.159,9.3599853515625," intangible as an experience, an idea, or the live stream continuum of thought, which"
274,00:24:59.159,00:25:02.759,3.5999755859375," you call you, is not little bitty."
275,00:25:02.759,00:25:09.559,6.800048828125," In fact, the neurosciences, which if you were intellectually honest about it, actually began"
276,00:25:09.559,00:25:12.919,3.3599853515625, in ancient Egypt and continue to this day.
277,00:25:12.919,00:25:16.019,3.0999755859375, The tools and toys have gotten better.
278,00:25:16.019,00:25:24.819,8.79998779296875," As Plato or Aristotle or philosophers all throughout the ages of time, even up until"
279,00:25:24.819,00:25:32.499,7.6800537109375," this very moment that you watch this video, would have asked, how does the non-physical"
280,00:25:32.499,00:25:35.059,2.55999755859375, control the physical?
281,00:25:35.059,00:25:37.259,2.199951171875, But the paradox is real.
282,00:25:37.259,00:25:44.779,7.52001953125," The mind-body duality, the split, the place where you have the blurring of the lines between"
283,00:25:44.779,00:25:51.899,7.1199951171875," what they'll call the dimension of consciousness and the material world, in fact, it's not"
284,00:25:51.899,00:25:54.699,2.79998779296875," just a blurring, fuzziness of the lines."
285,00:25:54.699,00:26:01.999,7.300048828125, That's the exact point where physical and spiritual twist inside this construct.
286,00:26:01.999,00:26:08.579,6.5799560546875, There are billions and billions and billions of neurons that are all acting with little
287,00:26:08.579,00:26:13.619,5.0400390625, synapses firing this way and that.
288,00:26:13.619,00:26:15.699,2.0799560546875, It's translating.
289,00:26:15.699,00:26:17.339,1.6400146484375, It's a receiver.
290,00:26:17.339,00:26:24.739,7.4000244140625," Nobel Prize winner neurophysiologist Sir John Eccles stated, and I quote, the human brain"
291,00:26:24.739,00:26:29.259,4.51995849609375, is a machine that a ghost can operate.
292,00:26:29.259,00:26:35.979,6.72003173828125, So that you can have control of this entire being passing down the spinal cord into the
293,00:26:35.979,00:26:41.259,5.27996826171875, fingertips and every part of your biological body.
294,00:26:41.259,00:26:43.219,1.96002197265625, What are we really?
295,00:26:43.219,00:26:46.659,3.44000244140625, What is the soul?
296,00:26:46.659,00:26:54.819,8.15997314453125, But this is more than just a computer sitting on top of a biological machine.
297,00:26:54.819,00:27:01.539,6.72003173828125," Just like you'll hear researchers ask, what is the source for the digital coding that"
298,00:27:01.539,00:27:05.979,4.44000244140625," makes up the software, the DNA of human life?"
299,00:27:05.979,00:27:14.819,8.8399658203125," This question here is a granddaddy beyond human imagination, larger in scope than that."
300,00:27:14.819,00:27:21.259,6.44000244140625," In fact, the very type of questions that have pushed many of the greatest minds throughout"
301,00:27:21.259,00:27:25.099,3.84002685546875, all time to the brinks of their research.
302,00:27:25.099,00:27:26.099,1.0, Who are we?
303,00:27:26.099,00:27:27.099,1.0, Where do we come from?
304,00:27:27.099,00:27:29.639,2.53997802734375, What happens next?
305,00:27:29.639,00:27:37.519,7.8800048828125," It was Albert Einstein who said, and I quote, in consideration of the cosmos, the order"
306,00:27:37.519,00:27:45.479,7.96002197265625," of the universe, which I, with my limited human mind, am able to perceive, yet there"
307,00:27:45.479,00:27:50.839,5.3599853515625, are those who say there is no God.
308,00:27:50.839,00:27:58.599,7.760009765625, What makes me really angry is when they quote me in support of such views.
309,00:27:58.599,00:28:01.199,2.5999755859375, That was Albert Einstein.
310,00:28:01.199,00:28:09.159,7.96002197265625, It's very rare that you would ever find any quote where Einstein would say he was angry
311,00:28:09.159,00:28:20.119,10.96002197265625," about anything, yet so often I hear men quote Einstein and say that there is no God in the"
312,00:28:20.119,00:28:21.599,1.47998046875, same sentence.
313,00:28:21.599,00:28:25.599,4.0," In fact, this is a lot larger in scope than that."
314,00:28:25.599,00:28:28.679,3.08001708984375, Let me put this in perspective for you.
315,00:28:28.679,00:28:36.439,7.75994873046875," Right now, while you're watching this video, we barely understand even the simplest functionings"
316,00:28:36.439,00:28:40.159,3.72003173828125, of the smallest parts of this place.
317,00:28:40.159,00:28:44.359,4.20001220703125, We grapple with the DNA strands.
318,00:28:44.359,00:28:50.999,6.6400146484375, This right here is a whole lot larger in scope than any of that.
319,00:28:50.999,00:28:59.999,9.0," Just within the neurosciences, as well as the life sciences sitting right on top."
320,00:28:59.999,00:29:09.439,9.43994140625," Life sciences, neurosciences, and that human mind and consciousness all meet."
321,00:29:09.439,00:29:17.319,7.8800048828125," There is no point in just those two sciences, almost like a gateway, huh?"
322,00:29:17.319,00:29:23.639,6.32000732421875, We haven't even made it to the quantum physics and the fabric of this place yet.
323,00:29:23.639,00:29:29.879,6.239990234375," You've probably heard it said that the eyes are the windows to the soul, a statement whose"
324,00:29:29.879,00:29:38.519,8.6400146484375," origin is actually derived from Matthew 6.22, but the truth is the illusion is a lot deeper"
325,00:29:38.519,00:29:38.799,0.280029296875, in here.
326,00:29:38.799,00:29:45.599,6.800000190734863," scope than that, because it's not actually the eyes that see anything at all."
327,00:29:45.599,00:29:56.839,11.24000072479248," The most advanced camera in the world, literally plugged in and tuned to the frequency of the"
328,00:29:56.839,00:29:58.759,1.9199981689453125, material world.
329,00:29:58.759,00:30:06.359,7.600000381469727," They're collecting the waves of light, which at their base are little quantified digital"
330,00:30:06.359,00:30:13.039,6.680002212524414," units, packets of light that enter through the eye."
331,00:30:13.039,00:30:15.879,2.8400001525878906, Solidness is an illusion.
332,00:30:15.879,00:30:21.799,5.9199981689453125," And when you're looking at something, you're actually seeing every color it's not."
333,00:30:21.799,00:30:25.879,4.0800018310546875, You're seeing the color that it rejects.
334,00:30:25.879,00:30:29.259,3.3799972534179688, But it's not just about the color of something.
335,00:30:29.259,00:30:37.379,8.120002746582031," If you were to really look at reality, the way that it is, it's comprised of zipping"
336,00:30:37.379,00:30:47.179,9.799995422363281," little digits, quantized units, 99.9% empty space."
337,00:30:47.179,00:30:54.819,7.6399993896484375," Was Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr, who, mind you, gave us an actual model of the atom,"
338,00:30:54.819,00:31:02.019,7.200004577636719," who stated, and I quote, those who are not shocked by quantum mechanics have not yet"
339,00:31:02.019,00:31:03.659,1.6399993896484375, understood it.

341,00:31:11.779,00:31:19.299,7.519996643066406, sufficient at this point to simply understand that what you're looking at is data coming
342,00:31:19.299,00:31:28.579,9.279998779296875," in through the eye, going down the optic nerve, translating into images, and then hits"

345,00:31:40.939,00:31:47.739,6.8000030517578125," This very much implies that the real you is much more than the software, the hardware,"
346,00:31:47.739,00:31:50.579,2.839996337890625, the biological machine.
347,00:31:50.579,00:31:55.779,5.1999969482421875, It does seem like there's a little bit more going on here than what meets the eye.
348,00:31:55.779,00:32:04.019,8.240005493164062," Let me ask you this, if your consciousness is separate from your physical body, and your"
349,00:32:04.019,00:32:15.579,11.55999755859375," physical body dies, then that would have to mean that you still exist, right?"
350,00:32:15.579,00:32:18.179,2.600006103515625, Let that one sink in a minute.
351,00:32:18.179,00:32:26.779,8.599990844726562," Now in the Greek text of Romans 12.2, it says something fascinating, it says, be not conformed"

353,00:32:33.299,00:32:41.299,8.0," Now when I think about transformed, I sort of think about a caterpillar in this cocoon"
354,00:32:41.299,00:32:42.299,1.0, state.
355,00:32:42.299,00:32:49.419,7.1199951171875," And I'll tell you, when the caterpillar goes into that cocoon, it becomes literally a black"
356,00:32:49.419,00:32:50.419,1.0, goo.
357,00:32:50.419,00:32:58.579,8.160003662109375," It loses all body form inside that cocoon, completely changes."
358,00:32:58.579,00:33:07.739,9.160003662109375, How could the caterpillar ever imagine becoming what it was literally born to become?
359,00:33:07.739,00:33:13.379,5.6399993896484375, Sometimes I'll hear physicists say that the universe is really large.
360,00:33:13.379,00:33:16.659,3.279998779296875," My first thought is, compared to what?"
361,00:33:16.659,00:33:18.399,1.7400054931640625, And we don't know how it does it.
362,00:33:18.399,00:33:25.139,6.7400054931640625, How could a body form literally change into something else?
363,00:33:25.139,00:33:34.059,8.919998168945312," Something that beautiful, but yet it does it, as if it's built right in to the program"
364,00:33:34.059,00:33:36.939,2.8800048828125, itself.
365,00:33:36.939,00:33:42.539,5.5999908447265625," Imagine for a moment that you were a sperm cell, just a little bitty cell."
366,00:33:42.539,00:33:45.699,3.160003662109375," And here you are, and you're headed towards the egg."
367,00:33:45.699,00:33:52.939,7.2400054931640625," And imagine that you're conscious, and there is no way you could possibly ever imagine"
368,00:33:52.939,00:33:56.699,3.7599945068359375, what it was that you were born to become.
369,00:33:56.699,00:34:03.019,6.32000732421875, How could it possibly know that it was about to go from its little bitty tiny world to
370,00:34:03.019,00:34:07.179,4.160003662109375, one beyond imagination?
371,00:34:07.179,00:34:13.579,6.399993896484375," Now as that sperm cell, you could easily look at other sperm cells that have gone over into"
372,00:34:13.579,00:34:18.939,5.3599853515625, a corner or some place where they've sort of gathered over here or over here.
373,00:34:18.939,00:34:23.819,4.8800048828125," You could easily get scared or sidetracked, it's a big place."
374,00:34:23.819,00:34:31.219,7.399993896484375, Or you can come into perfect alignment with what you're designed to become.
375,00:34:31.219,00:34:37.939,6.720001220703125," Imagine straight up keeping your eyes on the prize of that egg, going straight forward"
376,00:34:37.939,00:34:45.939,8.0, and by that mechanism become a victor born to emerge.
377,00:34:45.939,00:34:53.419,7.480010986328125," By the way, even despite the larger scope, which we're going to look at, that does mean"
378,00:34:53.419,00:34:57.419,4.0, that you were a winner at the very start of this thing.
379,00:34:57.419,00:35:06.499,9.079986572265625," No matter how you cut it, that right there is God's greatest gift of a birthday present."
380,00:35:06.499,00:35:11.979,5.480010986328125," You don't get to pick it from the start, but you do get to decide what you're going to"
381,00:35:11.979,00:35:17.299,5.32000732421875," do with it, and what voices you're going to listen to."
382,00:35:17.299,00:35:24.059,6.759979248046875," The gatekeeper against, shall we say, any little pushy things?"
383,00:35:24.059,00:35:31.339,7.279998779296875," Before we can go larger in scope and look at the full scale of what we're dealing with,"
384,00:35:31.339,00:35:41.139,9.79998779296875," I'd like to take a peek at evolution, which states that all of this that we've just discussed"
385,00:35:41.139,00:35:45.099,3.959991455078125, came out of sheer randomness.
386,00:35:45.099,00:35:50.339,5.240020751953125, This is important because these are two entirely different paths.
387,00:35:50.339,00:35:58.739,8.399993896484375," One, the evolution, we just keep getting lucky, lotto win after lotto win, but bottom line,"
388,00:35:58.739,00:36:06.819,8.079986572265625," random accidents keep mysteriously hitting lotto wins, and it's all internalized."
389,00:36:06.819,00:36:14.019,7.20001220703125," What you see is what you get, and science, and the disconnect, possibly, between the"
390,00:36:14.019,00:36:15.619,1.600006103515625, two of them.
391,00:36:15.619,00:36:24.859,9.239990234375," Or, it's larger in scope, and precision information has a source."
392,00:36:24.859,00:36:32.339,7.480010986328125, The definition of science actually is the study of the material and physical world and
393,00:36:32.339,00:36:40.659,8.32000732421875," universe based on observation, experimentation, and investigation."
394,00:36:40.659,00:36:42.579,1.91998291015625, So let's investigate it.
395,00:36:42.579,00:36:47.379,4.79998779296875," So, right from the beginning of this thing, we're going to give evolution some really,"
396,00:36:47.379,00:36:52.539,5.160003662109375," really big head starts, beginning with the universe itself."
397,00:36:52.539,00:36:58.059,5.519989013671875," At first glance, the universe can sort of look like maybe it's a random place, but in"
398,00:36:58.059,00:37:04.699,6.6400146484375, fact we have known for a long time now that the universe is very far from random.
399,00:37:04.699,00:37:08.099,3.399993896484375, This is commonly termed as the anthropic principle.
400,00:37:08.099,00:37:14.059,5.959991455078125," In fact, more than that, if you were to really look at the physics of this place, you would"
401,00:37:14.059,00:37:21.419,7.360015869140625," find 1% off this way, 1% off that way, is a bad, bad thing."
402,00:37:21.419,00:37:25.179,3.760009765625, You and I would not be talking at all.
403,00:37:25.179,00:37:30.639,5.459991455078125, Anthropic means that it has to be exactly the way that it is for us to exist.
404,00:37:30.639,00:37:36.099,5.459991455078125," More than that, when it comes to, say, the cosmological constant, you wouldn't even"
405,00:37:36.099,00:37:44.659,8.55999755859375, find an atheist physicist who would tell you that they believed that one was accidental.
406,00:37:44.659,00:37:51.859,7.20001220703125," The fine-tuning of the universe is not a little bitty issue, but nonetheless, we're going"
407,00:37:51.859,00:37:54.819,2.959991455078125, to start with the whole package.
408,00:37:54.819,00:38:01.019,6.20001220703125," Evolution gets the universe, the whole construct, and shebang with all of its precision from"
409,00:38:01.019,00:38:03.259,2.239990234375, the beginning for free.
410,00:38:03.259,00:38:08.859,5.600006103515625," And within the inside of that universe, we're throwing in the earth as well."
411,00:38:08.859,00:38:14.499,5.6400146484375, Don't worry about that big number there and all of those impossibilities.
412,00:38:14.499,00:38:21.019,6.51995849609375, We're tossing it into the package for free for evolution as well.
413,00:38:21.019,00:38:29.459,8.44000244140625," Evolution does also appear to defy entropy, the second law of thermodynamics, that things"
414,00:38:29.459,00:38:31.259,1.800048828125, decline over time.
415,00:38:31.259,00:38:33.979,2.719970703125, We see species go extinct.
416,00:38:33.979,00:38:41.059,7.08001708984375," We don't have one recorded example of a new species ever becoming, but we do have plenty"
417,00:38:41.059,00:38:44.499,3.44000244140625, examples of species going away.
418,00:38:44.499,00:38:48.939,4.44000244140625, The dinosaurs would be an example of that.
419,00:38:48.939,00:38:55.819,6.8800048828125," So it violates entropy, but don't worry, we're going to go ahead and give evolution a free"
420,00:38:55.819,00:39:00.339,4.51995849609375, pass on that one as well for the purpose of this.
421,00:39:00.339,00:39:07.339,7.0," It is true that evolution also violates biogenesis, which states, of course, that life only comes"
422,00:39:07.339,00:39:10.739,3.4000244140625, from other life.
423,00:39:10.739,00:39:17.239,6.5," Evolutionist Sir Fred Hoyle stated, and I quote, that believing that the first cell"
424,00:39:17.239,00:39:24.419,7.17999267578125, arrived by chance and accident is like believing that a tornado could sweep through a junkyard
425,00:39:24.419,00:39:27.499,3.08001708984375, and create a Boeing 747.
426,00:39:27.499,00:39:34.499,7.0," It's not just species that we don't see becoming, but on the cellular level, we've never seen"
427,00:39:34.499,00:39:38.459,3.9599609375, a cell come from anything other than another cell.
428,00:39:38.459,00:39:47.019,8.56005859375," Now just like entropy, we see cells go away, we see them mutate and die, but never see"
429,00:39:47.019,00:39:49.299,2.27996826171875, a cell become.
430,00:39:49.299,00:39:57.019,7.719970703125," Just like the cell, we've also never seen a DNA strand come on its own."
431,00:39:57.019,00:40:04.099,7.08001708984375," Digital coding for life, any kind of life, even the smallest form of life, we've never"
432,00:40:04.099,00:40:07.099,3.0, seen the digital coding become.
433,00:40:07.099,00:40:12.299,5.20001220703125," That's another problem, and you need both simultaneously, but for the purpose of this,"
434,00:40:12.299,00:40:13.299,1.0, we're going to do that.
435,00:40:13.299,00:40:18.979,5.67999267578125," It gets the cell, and it gets the coding, both combined from the start."
436,00:40:18.979,00:40:28.059,9.0799560546875," So I need the digital coding for life to happen from inorganic materials somehow, whether"
437,00:40:28.059,00:40:34.699,6.6400146484375," it be Moses, sort of a volcano did it, or others proposed lightning struck and produced"
438,00:40:34.699,00:40:40.459,5.760009765625," the digital coding, or if you want to view that things were shaking around in sort of"
439,00:40:40.459,00:40:42.499,2.03997802734375, a cosmic soup.
440,00:40:42.499,00:40:51.979,9.48004150390625," By some mechanism, I need actual sophisticated code that is tens and tens and tens of thousands"
441,00:40:51.979,00:41:01.739,9.760009765625, of times more advanced than this laptop and the entire computer setup combined in every
442,00:41:01.739,00:41:03.939,2.199951171875, single strand.
443,00:41:03.939,00:41:07.139,3.20001220703125, It can't have any junk code in there.
444,00:41:07.139,00:41:14.219,7.08001708984375," It's got to be tit for tat on every line, because the digital software is making up"
445,00:41:14.219,00:41:22.979,8.760009765625," the living instructions, click by click by click, line by line, for life itself."
446,00:41:22.979,00:41:30.179,7.199951171875, But even though the three-dimensional digital coding for just one single strand of DNA is
447,00:41:30.179,00:41:39.619,9.44000244140625," really incredibly complex for us, that's just where it begins to get tough, because"
448,00:41:39.619,00:41:49.699,10.08001708984375, now I've got to have trillions and trillions of strands of digital software come together
449,00:41:49.699,00:42:00.099,10.4000244140625, like a perfect glove coordinating in each precision piece to create little bitty fingers
450,00:42:00.099,00:42:05.699,5.5999755859375, and little arms and little legs and little bitty toes.
451,00:42:05.699,00:42:13.019,7.32000732421875," Then I need different kinds of software to all come together for every type of tissue,"
452,00:42:13.019,00:42:22.019,9.0," for the nervous system, for all of the functionality, including the human mind itself."
453,00:42:22.019,00:42:31.819,9.79998779296875," Every organ, every cell, every system, all built and comprised and pulled together from"
454,00:42:31.819,00:42:40.579,8.760009765625," digital software, including all of the billions of neurons that make up the brain."
455,00:42:40.579,00:42:50.379,9.79998779296875," And then, as the final touch, you need the miracle of miracles itself, consciousness."
456,00:42:50.379,00:42:59.939,9.55999755859375, It does sort of seem like an awful lot of very mysterious accidents.
457,00:42:59.939,00:43:05.339,5.4000244140625," Was Dr. Chuck Missler, a man who received congressional appointment to the U.S. Naval"

462,00:43:29.859,00:43:32.299,2.44000244140625," who stated, and I quote,"
463,00:43:32.299,00:43:41.179,8.87994384765625, It is only when one becomes truly knowledgeable of science itself that one becomes extremely
464,00:43:41.179,00:43:44.979,3.800048828125, comfortable with the book of Genesis.
465,00:43:44.979,00:43:51.659,6.67999267578125, But don't worry about biogenesis for the purpose of this test of evolution.

471,00:44:12.579,00:44:16.619,4.03997802734375, I'm going to give it to it for free from the start.
472,00:44:16.619,00:44:22.419,5.800048828125, We're also going to need our symbiotic relationships as well.
473,00:44:22.419,00:44:30.739,8.32000732421875," Everything here, most especially the biological living life forms on this planet, are dependent"

479,00:45:02.339,00:45:07.419,5.079999923706055," dependent on. And to be intellectually more honest about it, it would probably turn out"
480,00:45:07.419,00:45:14.179,6.760002136230469," to be the entirety of all of the systems on the earth itself, or a significant portion"

482,00:45:20.699,00:45:28.859,8.15999984741211," toss all of that stuff out of the mix. In Genesis 1.11 it states, God said, let the"
483,00:45:28.859,00:45:37.299,8.44000244140625," earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after"
484,00:45:37.299,00:45:47.299,10.0," its kind. Single cell, again, the odds of one cell in this place are 10 to the 39,970"
485,00:45:47.299,00:45:53.739,6.44000244140625," to 1. For one single cell, of course anything over 10 to the 50th power in mathematics is"
486,00:45:53.739,00:46:01.299,7.55999755859375, considered absolutely absurd. They're believed to be 10 to the 82nd power atoms in the entirety
487,00:46:01.299,00:46:07.659,6.3600006103515625," of the universe. But for the purpose of this, we're going to have to, at bare minimum, give"
488,00:46:07.659,00:46:16.219,8.55999755859375, our test the symbiotic relationship of at least the plants. And tree yielding fruit
489,00:46:16.219,00:46:25.779,9.55999755859375, whose seed was already in itself after his kind also. And God saw that it was good. We
490,00:46:25.779,00:46:32.499,6.720001220703125," definitely need the plants because we're breathing oxygen in. These plants are really, really"
491,00:46:32.499,00:46:40.379,7.8800048828125," critical. Now we need many, many things that are beating those same odds coming into existence"

493,00:46:47.539,00:46:53.339,5.8000030517578125," the plants, we're going to find that the systems for the plants that are running the seeds"
494,00:46:53.339,00:47:01.939,8.599990844726562," are symbiotic systems as well. You don't get the plant without the seed. And the seed,"
495,00:47:01.939,00:47:08.939,7.0," mind you, is a biological program as well. It's got all of the coating intact with no"
496,00:47:08.939,00:47:15.939,7.0, spare coating to make a plant or a tree. It's got to have all of its little parts doing
497,00:47:15.939,00:47:22.179,6.2400054931640625," all of their little jobs from the start. But nonetheless, for the purpose of this test,"
498,00:47:22.179,00:47:27.099,4.9199981689453125," it gets the cell, it gets the seeds, it gets the trees, it gets the coating, it gets to"
499,00:47:27.099,00:47:34.099,7.0," violate the entropy, which we observe every single day that things decline over time,"
500,00:47:34.099,00:47:41.099,7.0, not improve. You and I are also going to give it a free pass on all of the lotto wins that
501,00:47:41.099,00:47:46.619,5.5200042724609375, it's got to redundantly win. We're going to give it as many of those as it needs time
502,00:47:46.619,00:47:53.619,7.0," and time again for the purpose of this test, as well as allowing it to ignore all of the"
503,00:47:53.619,00:47:59.779,6.1599884033203125," symbiotic relationships, which would have to develop simultaneously. There's another"
504,00:47:59.779,00:48:06.779,7.0, real big one that we're going to have to kick out of the mix. Mendel's Laws of Genetics.
505,00:48:06.779,00:48:13.779,7.0," Sort of a large third strike, as well as their modern day refinements. It's not like we"
506,00:48:13.779,00:48:20.779,7.0, just started studying genetics yesterday. We're talking about biological software. I
507,00:48:20.779,00:48:27.779,7.0," hate to even compare DNA strands to any of our stuff. For example, DNA uses 4-bit code."
508,00:48:27.779,00:48:34.779,7.0, Our computer software uses 2-bit binary code. Little 1's and little 0's. This is 4-bit.
509,00:48:34.779,00:48:41.779,7.0000152587890625," This is 3-dimensional. Each different type of strand of genetic software, the odds against"
510,00:48:41.779,00:48:48.779,7.0," it existing, are 1 in 48, with 48 0's behind it. So that's 1 in 48 octillion to 1 against"
511,00:48:48.779,00:48:55.779,7.0, each piece of digital software existing at all. The programming software has the odds
512,00:48:55.779,00:49:02.779,7.0," has got to work seamlessly with these cellular factories, which in their inner worlds are"
513,00:49:02.779,00:49:09.779,7.0," more tit-for-tat, precise, more efficient than any computerized, automated factories"
514,00:49:09.779,00:49:16.779,7.0, on the planet Earth. The list of these things could keep on going. DNA is the literal software.
515,00:49:16.779,00:49:23.779,7.0," The living programming, line-by-line specific, for every single cute, soft, warm, and cuddly,"
516,00:49:23.779,00:49:30.779,7.0," and even the strangest of things. Bottom line, DNA is the software which makes up all of"
517,00:49:30.779,00:49:37.779,7.0, the different types and kinds of species on this planet. Each creature has exactly the
518,00:49:37.779,00:49:44.779,7.0," coding that it needs to become whatever type, kind, or species of creature that it is. There"
519,00:49:44.779,00:49:51.779,7.0," is no junk code in DNA, nor is there junk code in the cells, which the DNA software"
520,00:49:51.779,00:49:58.779,7.0," runs inside of, or the organs which those cells make up, or the entire functional systems"
521,00:49:58.779,00:50:05.779,7.0, of the living biological organisms themselves. And every type of creature has exactly the
522,00:50:05.779,00:50:12.779,7.0, same code. Every creature has zero mutating parts on its body that would hinder its chances
523,00:50:12.779,00:50:19.779,7.0," for survival. If it had things mutating, even worse. If it gets any type of genetic defect"
524,00:50:19.779,00:50:26.779,7.0," or mutation, any type of randomness introduced into this precision, tit-for-tat, line-by-line"
525,00:50:26.779,00:50:33.779,7.0," coding, can not only injure the creature, it can kill it. That's all just the baseline"
526,00:50:33.779,00:50:40.779,7.0," stuff. If we were to leave Mendel's laws of genetics into this test of evolution, that"
527,00:50:40.779,00:50:47.779,7.0," would, let's just say, it kicks up the toughness for this guy here another few trillion notches."
528,00:50:47.779,00:50:54.779,7.0, The genetic software that makes up a bunny rabbit is entirely different from that that
529,00:50:54.779,00:51:01.779,7.0, makes up a turtle. The two cannot mate. It is a software disconnect. When you're dealing
530,00:51:01.779,00:51:08.779,7.0," with biological software, just like dealing with regular software, programming, and the"
531,00:51:08.779,00:51:15.779,7.0," coding has to match up, line-by-line-by-line. Different programs have different coding,"
532,00:51:15.779,00:51:22.779,7.0, and they're only designed to work with specifically the coding that works with each program.
533,00:51:22.779,00:51:29.779,7.0," The genetic coding, the actual digital software, has to match up, line-by-line-by-line, with"
534,00:51:29.779,00:51:36.779,7.0," each program. The genetic coding, the actual digital software inherent in dogs, at least"
535,00:51:36.779,00:51:43.779,7.0," naturally, without any engineering done, any intelligence, or any mucking with the code,"
536,00:51:43.779,00:51:50.779,7.0," the software inherent in dogs will only work, or produce, other breeds, other kinds of dogs."
537,00:51:50.779,00:51:57.779,7.0, It's only compatible with other dog types. Mendel's laws of genetics apply to every species
538,00:51:57.779,00:52:04.779,7.0, type on this planet. There are specific body plans from the smallest little things that
539,00:52:04.779,00:52:11.339,6.55999755859375, creep and crawl to the largest creatures on the face of the planet Earth. Same thing applies
540,00:52:11.339,00:52:18.339,7.0," with horses and those that breed horses. With horses, the genetic code inherent in"
541,00:52:18.339,00:52:25.339,7.0," these creatures is only compatible and can only produce, by any natural cause, other"
542,00:52:25.339,00:52:32.339,7.0, breeds of horses. These genetic laws are particularly important when you're dealing with animals
543,00:52:32.339,00:52:39.339,7.0," that look very, very similar, if not identical, in many, many ways. They may even have parts"
544,00:52:39.339,00:52:46.339,7.0, within their bodies that are absolutely identical to one another. Appearances can be deceiving.
545,00:52:46.339,00:52:53.339,7.0, Just like if you had two separate factories with similar or identical machines in each
546,00:52:53.339,00:53:00.339,7.0," one, yet both factories are running different genetic software. You've probably heard it"
547,00:53:00.339,00:53:07.339,7.0," said that horses, or animals that were like horses, wanted to reach tree branches, which"
548,00:53:07.339,00:53:13.579,6.239990234375," were way up high, so the horses, over time, grew longer and longer necks so that they"
549,00:53:13.579,00:53:20.579,7.0," could get at those taller branches, eventually becoming giraffes. The truth is that the genetic"
550,00:53:20.579,00:53:27.579,7.0, coding for a giraffe and its biological systems are not even remotely close to the systems
551,00:53:27.579,00:53:34.579,7.0," of that of any type of horse. Just like with computer software, you need a source for every"
552,00:53:34.579,00:53:41.579,7.0," single line of code. Coding does not grow, it does not magically appear, whether it be"
553,00:53:41.579,00:53:48.579,7.0," biological coding or whether it be computer coding, and if you're missing code, if any"
554,00:53:48.579,00:53:55.579,7.0," of the digits are off, your system crashes. Your animal is in trouble. It's not the little"
555,00:53:55.579,00:54:02.579,7.0," train that thought it could. This is real coding that you need for every part, including"
556,00:54:02.579,00:54:09.579,7.0, a different circulatory system. This is not just wishful thinking. I want to click up
557,00:54:09.579,00:54:16.579,7.0," a larger neck. This is real. You need actual tit for tat for tit for tat, line for line"
558,00:54:16.579,00:54:23.579,7.0," for line for line, digital coding for every cell, every function, every part. All the"
559,00:54:23.579,00:54:30.579,7.0," way down the neck of this animal are blood vessels, arteries, which have literal valves."
560,00:54:30.579,00:54:37.579,7.0, This is going to take more walls of digital coding that will shut off and keep the animal
561,00:54:37.579,00:54:44.579,7.0," blood so that when it goes down for a drink of water, it will not pass out, which would"
562,00:54:44.579,00:54:51.579,7.0, most definitely injure its chances of survival. If it's trying to run or get away or it passes
563,00:54:51.579,00:54:57.579,6.0," out and drowns in the pool of water, or if the animal simply passes out every time it"
564,00:54:57.579,00:55:04.579,7.0," goes down for a drink, it's also got special sponge-like material on its mind to capture"
565,00:55:04.579,00:55:11.579,7.0," blood in. Those take more software so that when its neck goes up and down, that it will"
566,00:55:11.579,00:55:18.579,7.0," not again pass out and go unconscious. And to run these extra apparatus of the long neck,"
567,00:55:18.579,00:55:25.579,7.0," it needs a two and a half foot long heart, give or take. Entirely different heart, that's"
568,00:55:25.579,00:55:32.579,7.0, going to be a bunch of these. Pumping all of that circulatory blood through this long
569,00:55:32.579,00:55:39.579,7.0, neck. This isn't just a couple of little knick-knacks that are different. This animal has an entirely
570,00:55:39.579,00:55:46.579,7.0, different body plan. Software after software after software. If it were missing one piece
571,00:55:46.579,00:55:53.579,7.0," of any part of this, this animal, the giraffe, would not exist. Once again, from inorganic"
572,00:55:53.579,00:56:00.579,7.0," material, I need trillions of lines of precision three-dimensional software to mysteriously"
573,00:56:00.579,00:56:07.579,7.0," appear. And all of the precision factory machines to ultimately become a giraffe, it cannot"
574,00:56:07.579,00:56:14.579,7.0," stop there. From the inorganic material, it's got to also make trillions of more lines of"
575,00:56:14.579,00:56:21.579,7.0, code. The unbelievable machinery that has to go through and do all of the reading and
576,00:56:21.579,00:56:28.579,7.0," the duplicating to make complete baby elephants from inorganic material. But, the inorganic"
577,00:56:28.579,00:56:35.579,7.0," material definitely cannot stop there. Buku's and buku's and buku's. Point by point, no"
578,00:56:35.579,00:56:42.579,7.0," nonsense precision in every piece. Hunches of more living, breathing, living, living"
579,00:56:42.579,00:56:49.579,7.0," biological machines to somehow just strangely become. Cells are not just factories, they"
580,00:56:49.579,00:56:56.579,7.0," are literal living, breathing cities. Look at that thing go. Whirlwinds more coding to"
581,00:56:56.579,00:57:03.579,7.0," make lions, alligators, and the most vicious things on the planet Earth. Rivers more code."
582,00:57:03.579,00:57:11.579,8.0, From more inorganic material to make even the cutest of things.
583,00:57:11.579,00:57:14.859,3.2799999713897705, on this planet as well as
584,00:57:14.859,00:57:17.979,3.120000123977661, every single living
585,00:57:17.979,00:57:22.419,4.440000057220459, breathing creature on the face
586,00:57:22.419,00:57:27.059,4.6399993896484375, of the planet Earth.
587,00:57:27.059,00:57:33.659,6.600000381469727," It's a lot of lightning bolts. In the construct of this place, the matrix of"
588,00:57:33.659,00:57:37.899,4.239999771118164," the material world, this thing that we call reality, the entirety"
589,00:57:37.899,00:57:42.979,5.079999923706055, of little particles which make up the universe. Everything here
590,00:57:42.979,00:57:46.219,3.2399978637695312," is a causality, a cause"
591,00:57:46.219,00:57:50.459,4.240001678466797, and an effect. This becomes particularly important
592,00:57:50.459,00:57:54.219,3.759998321533203, in science when you can see
593,00:57:54.219,00:57:57.299,3.0800018310546875, the effect of something
594,00:57:57.299,00:58:01.379,4.0800018310546875, but you cannot see the larger scale
595,00:58:01.379,00:58:05.939,4.55999755859375, of what caused it. You know it's also true
596,00:58:05.939,00:58:11.499,5.55999755859375, that a created thing can never understand
597,00:58:11.499,00:58:15.299,3.8000030517578125, the scope of what created it.
598,00:58:15.299,00:58:21.299,6.0, At the inception of the book of Genesis it starts with a fascinating
599,00:58:21.299,00:58:24.659,3.3600006103515625," statement. It says, in the beginning"
600,00:58:24.659,00:58:27.859,3.1999969482421875," the God of gods, Yahweh,"
601,00:58:27.859,00:58:31.779,3.9199981689453125, created everything. Now the use of the word God
602,00:58:31.779,00:58:35.179,3.4000015258789062," in the Hebrew, in that sentence, Yahweh"
603,00:58:35.179,00:58:37.859,2.6800003051757812, means something a lot larger
604,00:58:37.859,00:58:41.819,3.9599990844726562, in scope than Zeus or a man in the clouds
605,00:58:41.819,00:58:44.939,3.1200027465820312, with a lightning bolt. It's actually stating
606,00:58:44.939,00:58:48.299,3.3600006103515625, in the text that our dad
607,00:58:48.299,00:58:51.579,3.279998779296875, is larger and more unimaginable
608,00:58:51.579,00:58:56.179,4.599998474121094, in scope than the construct of every single
609,00:58:56.179,00:59:00.019,3.839996337890625, three-dimensional particle pixel
610,00:59:00.019,00:59:03.059,3.0400009155273438, in the quantum live feed
611,00:59:03.059,00:59:06.099,3.0400009155273438, of little dots making up
612,00:59:06.099,00:59:10.299,4.200004577636719, the precision framework of this present
613,00:59:10.299,00:59:14.499,4.1999969482421875," illusion, the fabric of the entire"
614,00:59:14.499,00:59:17.859,3.3600006103515625, place. The text goes on to say
615,00:59:17.859,00:59:21.339,3.4800033569335938, and the earth was without form
616,00:59:21.339,00:59:24.419,3.0800018310546875, and void. Now in the original Hebrew
617,00:59:24.419,00:59:29.339,4.9199981689453125, that sentence actually reads and the earth had become
618,00:59:29.339,00:59:33.379,4.040008544921875, without form and void as if to indicate
619,00:59:33.379,00:59:36.579,3.1999969482421875," that the place itself, the entire"
620,00:59:36.579,00:59:39.979,3.399993896484375, construct is older
621,00:59:39.979,00:59:43.499,3.5200042724609375, than where our story begins.
622,00:59:43.499,00:59:46.699,3.1999969482421875, It goes on to say and darkness
623,00:59:46.699,00:59:50.899,4.1999969482421875," was on the face of the deep. Now many, many commentators"
624,00:59:50.899,00:59:55.139,4.2400054931640625, have speculated on that passage that it's talking about the water and the
625,00:59:55.139,00:59:56.539,1.399993896484375, oceans
626,00:59:56.539,00:59:59.859,3.32000732421875, and that is a possibility.
627,00:59:59.859,01:00:03.539,3.67999267578125, What's interesting is that the word darkness
628,01:00:03.539,01:00:07.139,3.600006103515625," is a very, very heavy metaphor"
629,01:00:07.139,01:00:12.579,5.44000244140625, word. You know I'm wondering if the text is referring to
630,01:00:12.579,01:00:16.659,4.0800018310546875, just regular darkness or
631,01:00:16.659,01:00:21.099,4.4399871826171875, if it's referencing something a little deeper
632,01:00:21.099,01:00:24.259,3.160003662109375, than that. And the word waters
633,01:00:24.259,01:00:27.219,2.9600067138671875, or celestial waters in
634,01:00:27.219,01:00:32.019,4.8000030517578125, every ancient culture meant the entirety
635,01:00:32.019,01:00:35.299,3.279998779296875," of the universe, the place where the stars"
636,01:00:35.299,01:00:39.219,3.9199981689453125, are. So it states and the Spirit
637,01:00:39.219,01:00:42.539,3.3199920654296875, of God moved upon the face
638,01:00:42.539,01:00:46.339,3.8000030517578125, of the waters and God said
639,01:00:46.339,01:00:50.219,3.8800048828125, let there be light. Now the word light
640,01:00:50.219,01:00:53.859,3.6399993896484375, is another extremely
641,01:00:53.859,01:00:57.019,3.160003662109375, heavy metaphor word
642,01:00:57.019,01:01:00.499,3.4799957275390625, and God saw that the light
643,01:01:00.499,01:01:04.619,4.1199951171875, was good and God divided
644,01:01:04.619,01:01:08.579,3.9600067138671875, the light from the darkness.
645,01:01:08.579,01:01:12.539,3.959991455078125, What's funny is that even as a human and
646,01:01:12.539,01:01:15.979,3.44000244140625, designing something on a computer
647,01:01:15.979,01:01:19.459,3.4799957275390625," per se, what I'll do when I begin a new project"
648,01:01:19.459,01:01:22.979,3.5200042724609375, is I'll separate my old stuff from my
649,01:01:22.979,01:01:26.739,3.760009765625, new stuff and make a clean slate.
650,01:01:26.739,01:01:31.539,4.79998779296875, It's at that point in the text that you begin
651,01:01:31.539,01:01:35.259,3.720001220703125, with your dramatic rise
652,01:01:35.259,01:01:39.899,4.6400146484375, in order in the place itself. This systematic rise
653,01:01:39.899,01:01:44.859,4.959991455078125, almost as systematic and step-by-step precise
654,01:01:44.859,01:01:49.219,4.3599853515625, as the order which rises when a DNA strand
655,01:01:49.219,01:01:52.899,3.680023193359375," opens to become a living, breathing"
656,01:01:52.899,01:01:56.219,3.32000732421875, life form. Whatever the case
657,01:01:56.219,01:02:00.539,4.32000732421875, let's swim a little further upstream and see
658,01:02:00.539,01:02:03.699,3.15997314453125, if we can't get our head up above
659,01:02:03.699,01:02:10.259,6.560028076171875, the water. It is true that inorganic material no matter how much you shake it
660,01:02:10.259,01:02:15.819,5.55999755859375, or cosmic soup it does not generally start
661,01:02:15.819,01:02:18.859,3.03997802734375, spitting out digital coding.
662,01:02:18.859,01:02:22.619,3.760009765625, Even dealing with the smallest little microbes
663,01:02:22.619,01:02:25.699,3.079986572265625, on the face of the planet earth like this little virus
664,01:02:25.699,01:02:31.019,5.32000732421875, of E. coli that I've got going on the screen right here. The software has got to be a
665,01:02:31.019,01:02:32.779,1.760009765625, pre-programmed match
666,01:02:32.779,01:02:38.139,5.3599853515625, on every line just like in a computer program and they can only interbreed
667,01:02:38.139,01:02:42.819,4.680023193359375, within their kind like viruses do lateral gene transfers just as
668,01:02:42.819,01:02:46.299,3.47998046875, dogs and other animals can only mate within
669,01:02:46.299,01:02:51.899,5.600006103515625," or share genes within their specific track of animals. Turtles with turtles,"
670,01:02:51.899,01:02:53.539,1.639984130859375, bunny rabbits with bunny rabbits.
671,01:02:53.539,01:02:57.299,3.760009765625," Bottom line whether you're dealing with the littlest bug,"
672,01:02:57.299,01:03:01.419,4.1199951171875, the largest buffalo or the pristine
673,01:03:01.419,01:03:04.379,2.959991455078125, pentacle of human
674,01:03:04.379,01:03:08.139,3.760009765625, life itself. You are gonna need
675,01:03:08.139,01:03:13.819,5.67999267578125, the source code. Tuck the fact that I brought up viruses into the back your
676,01:03:13.819,01:03:18.059,4.239990234375, mind. Little bitty guys that like to come into a cell like a little bitty missile
677,01:03:18.059,01:03:21.659,3.600006103515625, and convince the host that their voice is the one
678,01:03:21.659,01:03:26.259,4.600006103515625, that the cell should be listening to it before they crawl in there and
679,01:03:26.259,01:03:29.299,3.040008544921875, create a tumor or a cancer and add
680,01:03:29.299,01:03:32.579,3.279998779296875, their code to the mix. Just like what happens
681,01:03:32.579,01:03:36.059,3.47998046875, on computer software when a virus
682,01:03:36.059,01:03:39.899,3.84002685546875, wiggles its way in. Perhaps also when
683,01:03:39.899,01:03:44.779,4.879974365234375, arriving at the dimensional scope of things you not only have
684,01:03:44.779,01:03:48.379,3.600006103515625, larger scale issues but perhaps as well
685,01:03:48.379,01:03:51.379,3.0, there are little buggers and unfriendlies
686,01:03:51.379,01:03:55.419,4.040008544921875, in dimensional structures as well.
687,01:03:55.419,01:03:59.059,3.6400146484375, Oh one more little bitty detail
688,01:03:59.059,01:04:02.539,3.47998046875, before I forget the amalgamation
689,01:04:02.539,01:04:06.819,4.279998779296875, of 66 ancient documents that we call
690,01:04:06.819,01:04:10.499,3.67999267578125, the Holy Bible is redundant to express
691,01:04:10.499,01:04:14.259,3.760009765625, one single message over and over and over and over
692,01:04:14.259,01:04:18.979,4.720001220703125, again that the scope of what's going on here
693,01:04:18.979,01:04:23.699,4.720001220703125, is larger than the planets or the stars
694,01:04:23.699,01:04:26.899,3.20001220703125, or the molecular fabric of the skin
695,01:04:26.899,01:04:30.699,3.79998779296875, or even the quantum particles that make up
696,01:04:30.699,01:04:34.019,3.32000732421875, the matrix of the whole place.
697,01:04:34.019,01:04:38.099,4.079986572265625, That what the creator of the heavens and the earth
698,01:04:38.099,01:04:41.259,3.160003662109375, is interested in has nothing to do
699,01:04:41.259,01:04:45.299,4.040008544921875," with the software, the hardware, the biological"
700,01:04:45.299,01:04:49.099,3.800018310546875, bag of parts that we call a human body
701,01:04:49.099,01:04:52.579,3.47998046875, or the roller coaster ride of minutes
702,01:04:52.579,01:04:55.779,3.20001220703125, that we define as a human life
703,01:04:55.779,01:04:59.499,3.720001220703125," but the scope, the precious treasure"
704,01:04:59.499,01:05:04.659,5.160003662109375, the gem amongst the darkness that he is seeking out
705,01:05:04.659,01:05:08.179,3.519989013671875, and looking for. He's interested in the real deal
706,01:05:08.179,01:05:11.339,3.160003662109375, the point that's calling all the shots
707,01:05:11.339,01:05:15.699,4.3599853515625," for the whole puppet show, the precision parts"
708,01:05:15.699,01:05:18.899,3.20001220703125, he's interested in the real you
709,01:05:18.899,01:05:22.419,3.519989013671875, but according to those ancient pages
710,01:05:22.419,01:05:25.379,2.96002197265625, it doesn't matter whether you feel like you got served up
711,01:05:25.379,01:05:29.019,3.639984130859375, one coin at the start of this life or 10
712,01:05:29.019,01:05:33.299,4.279998779296875, where you came from or what place on the planet earth
713,01:05:33.299,01:05:36.019,2.720001220703125, you may have been born in truth
714,01:05:36.019,01:05:40.099,4.079986572265625, the particles that make up the human construct
715,01:05:40.099,01:05:44.259,4.1600341796875," are no different than those that make up the bunny rabbit, the turtle"
716,01:05:44.259,01:05:48.299,4.03997802734375, or the ground beneath your feet but the scope
717,01:05:48.299,01:05:53.299,5.0, of the differences in the human conscious condition
718,01:05:53.299,01:05:59.219,5.91998291015625, are larger than the light-year separator between the intellectual capacities
719,01:05:59.219,01:06:04.179,4.96002197265625, between us and any other living breathing creature
720,01:06:04.179,01:06:08.419,4.239990234375, on the face of the planet earth but according
721,01:06:08.419,01:06:11.899,3.47998046875, to those pages we are born
722,01:06:11.899,01:06:15.859,3.96002197265625, above things that even these primitive
723,01:06:15.859,01:06:19.539,3.67999267578125, eyes that see like cameras
724,01:06:19.539,01:06:23.979,4.44000244140625, are blind to. What I'm saying is this
725,01:06:23.979,01:06:27.779,3.79998779296875, appearances can be deceiving
726,01:06:27.779,01:06:31.139,3.36004638671875, the world you see with your eyes
727,01:06:31.139,01:06:34.419,3.27996826171875, this place couched
728,01:06:34.419,01:06:37.739,3.32000732421875, in a much larger spiritual
729,01:06:37.739,01:06:40.859,3.1199951171875, dimensional reality
730,01:06:40.859,01:06:44.139,3.280029296875, the masquerade of particles
731,01:06:44.139,01:06:47.779,3.63995361328125, pretending to be the illusion
732,01:06:47.779,01:06:51.619,3.84002685546875, of the material world. You know it is true
733,01:06:51.619,01:06:55.699,4.08001708984375, whether it be a king or a father
734,01:06:55.699,01:07:00.619,4.91998291015625, you generally see what someone would do with little
735,01:07:00.619,01:07:05.619,5.0, before you give them much but greater still
736,01:07:05.619,01:07:10.299,4.67999267578125, according to those pages the real you
737,01:07:10.299,01:07:15.099,4.800048828125, behind the machine infancy stage
738,01:07:15.099,01:07:20.579,5.47998046875, you were born to be heir to an empire
739,01:07:20.579,01:07:25.219,4.6400146484375, the beautiful test that's precisely
740,01:07:25.219,01:07:29.499,4.27996826171875, what those pages are saying
741,01:07:29.499,01:07:35.139,5.6400146484375, just thought I'd mention it but before we start looking at a larger scope or a
742,01:07:35.139,01:07:36.339,1.20001220703125, smaller scope
743,01:07:36.339,01:07:39.699,3.3599853515625, in this test of evolution we're gonna have to kick
744,01:07:39.699,01:07:44.219,4.52001953125, Mendel's laws of genetics out of the queue they conflict
745,01:07:44.219,01:07:49.819,5.5999755859375, with evolution. Now Mendel was a contemporary of Charles Darwin both men
746,01:07:49.819,01:07:54.459,4.6400146484375, lived and worked in roughly the same time period. Mendel's laws
747,01:07:54.459,01:07:58.819,4.3599853515625, of genetics would go on to be well the practical day-to-day observable
748,01:07:58.819,01:08:02.819,4.0, sciences that are used even this very hour that you're watching
749,01:08:02.819,01:08:06.339,3.52001953125, this video. They're dependent on sciences because they're observable. We can watch them
750,01:08:06.339,01:08:11.259,4.91998291015625, day after day after day after day after day. Whereas Charles Darwin's
751,01:08:11.259,01:08:14.859,3.60003662109375, theory of evolution would go on to
752,01:08:14.859,01:08:18.579,3.719970703125, violate lengthy lists of other sciences
753,01:08:18.579,01:08:22.139,3.55999755859375, for example in Darwin's day it was believed that life could
754,01:08:22.139,01:08:26.059,3.91998291015625, spontaneously generate by many many folks
755,01:08:26.059,01:08:30.099,4.0400390625, for example if a mold were to appear perhaps it had
756,01:08:30.099,01:08:34.099,4.0, spontaneously generated of course we now know that
757,01:08:34.099,01:08:38.019,3.91998291015625, spontaneous generation does not occur
758,01:08:38.019,01:08:41.939,3.91998291015625, Dr. A. Fleischman zoologist at Erlangen
759,01:08:41.939,01:08:47.099,5.1600341796875, University who stated and I quote the theory of evolution suffers from the
760,01:08:47.099,01:08:48.859,1.760009765625, gravest of defects
761,01:08:48.859,01:08:52.179,3.32000732421875, which are more and more apparent as time advances
762,01:08:52.179,01:08:56.219,4.03997802734375, it can no longer square with practical scientific knowledge
763,01:08:56.219,01:09:00.419,4.20001220703125, the law of information systems information
764,01:09:00.419,01:09:06.019,5.5999755859375, always has a source. Dr. David A. Kaufman University of Florida Gainesville
765,01:09:06.019,01:09:06.859,0.84002685546875, stated
766,01:09:06.859,01:09:10.099,3.239990234375, evolution lacks a scientifically acceptable
767,01:09:10.099,01:09:15.379,5.280029296875, explanation for the source of the precisely planned
768,01:09:15.379,01:09:19.859,4.47998046875, coding within cells without which there can be
769,01:09:19.859,01:09:23.259,3.39996337890625, no proteins hence no life
770,01:09:23.259,01:09:27.379,4.12005615234375, specified complexity sort of goes hand in hand with the law of information
771,01:09:27.379,01:09:30.179,2.79998779296875, systems what you're looking at
772,01:09:30.179,01:09:34.819,4.6400146484375, is specific information click click click click click click click
773,01:09:34.819,01:09:38.739,3.91998291015625, it is not random little bit this way little bit that way
774,01:09:38.739,01:09:43.939,5.20001220703125, it is direct streamline instructions that build
775,01:09:43.939,01:09:47.459,3.51995849609375, living biological organisms
776,01:09:47.459,01:09:51.139,3.67999267578125, irreducible complexity the entirety
777,01:09:51.139,01:09:55.819,4.6800537109375, of that organism is comprised of organs and parts
778,01:09:55.819,01:10:00.339,4.51995849609375, all of which it needs those parts are comprised
779,01:10:00.339,01:10:04.499,4.1600341796875, of cells which require all of their parts

805,01:11:48.780,01:11:53.459,4.67999267578125, here for weeks so I'm gonna rip all of it out
806,01:11:53.459,01:11:56.739,3.27996826171875, right this second toss it to the side
807,01:11:56.739,01:12:01.019,4.280029296875, level playing field let's put evolution
808,01:12:01.019,01:12:06.139,5.1199951171875, to the test it was in 1859 that Charles Darwin
809,01:12:06.139,01:12:08.139,2.0, proposed the origin of
810,01:12:08.139,01:12:14.999,6.860000133514404," species, things evolve into other things. So see the dog, he jumped in the water"
811,01:12:14.999,01:12:23.499,8.499999523162842," and he is deciding he's going to sort of grow these these fin-like things. See, so"
812,01:12:23.499,01:12:30.339,6.840001106262207," the dog ultimately turned into a whale. See how the theory works? Mind you, in"
813,01:12:30.339,01:12:37.699,7.35999870300293," 1859, when this was proposed by Darwin, it was believed at that time that a"
814,01:12:37.699,01:12:44.339,6.64000129699707, single cell was as complex as a ping-pong ball. And God created great
815,01:12:44.339,01:12:51.259,6.9199981689453125," whales and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth"
816,01:12:51.259,01:12:59.339,8.080001831054688," abundantly after their kinds. So here's one of the proposed charts, or ascent"
817,01:12:59.339,01:13:05.619,6.279998779296875," transition lines, for evolution. And you can see the the drawing here is"
818,01:13:05.619,01:13:10.699,5.0800018310546875," indicating that the fish is growing arms, which are gonna form a different"
819,01:13:10.699,01:13:15.699,4.999996185302734, head and become a tail. And now it's it's getting fingers down here. The problems
820,01:13:15.699,01:13:22.179,6.480003356933594," with this are intrinsic, beginning with, of course, the digital programming code"
821,01:13:22.179,01:13:31.539,9.360000610351562, of DNA is just like software coding for a program. If a program picks up any junk
822,01:13:31.539,01:13:41.219,9.680000305175781," code, error code, or mutation code into any of the lines of its complete coding,"
823,01:13:41.219,01:13:51.379,10.159996032714844, it will by no means make a better program. Even a single human finger is
824,01:13:51.379,01:14:00.259,8.8800048828125, beyond imagination in precision programming scope. But the problems are
825,01:14:00.259,01:14:06.819,6.55999755859375," larger than even the genetics. For practical example, you may have heard it"
826,01:14:06.819,01:14:15.179,8.360000610351562, said that dinosaurs became birds. A bird's wings make the neck on the giraffe
827,01:14:15.179,01:14:23.459,8.280006408691406, look like absolute child's play. You are talking about going from a functional
828,01:14:23.459,01:14:32.539,9.079986572265625," leg on an animal into an apparatus, a functional apparatus that flies. If you"
829,01:14:32.539,01:14:39.099,6.5600128173828125, took every piece of sophisticated military hardware for aviation that we
830,01:14:39.099,01:14:46.739,7.6399993896484375," have ever devised, collaborated them into one single entity or organism, you would"
831,01:14:46.739,01:14:55.899,9.159988403320312, be nowhere close to the sophistication of the systems on one single species of
832,01:14:55.899,01:15:03.899,8.0," bird. Our best technology, some of it extremely impressive, but also in terms"
833,01:15:03.899,01:15:16.579,12.680007934570312," of practical reality, primitive, sort of clunky, as well as resource-consuming,"
834,01:15:16.579,01:15:26.579,10.0," inefficient, and often very catastrophic by comparison to this creature right"
835,01:15:26.579,01:15:35.739,9.160003662109375," here, majesty of just one of these biological masterpieces. The birds sort"
836,01:15:35.739,01:15:41.539,5.79998779296875," of make the whole flying thing look easy, don't they? Not to mention the fact that"
837,01:15:41.539,01:15:49.699,8.160003662109375," if you've got a leg becoming a wing, it's going to be a bad leg long before it"
838,01:15:49.699,01:15:58.619,8.919998168945312," makes a good wing. If an animal was mutating in any way, that's going to injure its"
839,01:15:58.619,01:16:06.179,7.55999755859375, chances for survival. Not one change of species into another is on record. We
840,01:16:06.179,01:16:13.819,7.6399993896484375, cannot prove that a single species has ever changed. That quote is from none
841,01:16:13.819,01:16:22.699,8.8800048828125, other than Charles Darwin himself. Now each program on this screen has exactly
842,01:16:22.699,01:16:28.419,5.7199859619140625, the coding inside of it that it needs at the very start. Otherwise the program
843,01:16:28.419,01:16:36.419,8.0," would not exist. So if I've got a monkey that is slowly turning into a person,"
844,01:16:36.419,01:16:45.379,8.96002197265625, there has to be actual cellular coding for every little tiny piece of the
845,01:16:45.379,01:16:53.779,8.399993896484375, transition. Just like these computer programs on this screen will only open
846,01:16:53.779,01:17:02.779,9.0," to become what they are, because their lines of software coding only have the"
847,01:17:02.779,01:17:12.059,9.279998779296875, specific line-for-line instructions to open and become whatever the program is.
848,01:17:12.059,01:17:20.859,8.79998779296875," You need precise code for every single line, because just like computer software,"
849,01:17:20.859,01:17:28.379,7.52001953125, this coding has no extra instructions for making spare parts. It has exactly
850,01:17:28.379,01:17:36.420,8.040008544921875, inside those digital instructions the coding that it precisely needs to make
851,01:17:36.420,01:17:44.459,8.03997802734375," the organism exactly as it is, with no spare coding. What do you imagine might"
852,01:17:44.459,01:17:51.939,7.480010986328125, occur if I took one of these programs on this screen and began adding random
853,01:17:51.939,01:17:58.819,6.8800048828125, lines of mutant junk code to one of these programs on this screen? Would it
854,01:17:58.819,01:18:06.979,8.160003662109375," increase and make the program evolve to become a better program? Or option B, do"
855,01:18:06.979,01:18:14.579,7.5999755859375," you think that adding random code, junk code and mutation code, to precision"
856,01:18:14.579,01:18:22.539,7.96002197265625, genetic software might not ever get a dog to change body plans and all of its
857,01:18:22.539,01:18:28.539,6.0, genetic coding and become a whale? So what do you think? If we were to add junk
858,01:18:28.539,01:18:34.339,5.79998779296875," code to one of these pieces of software, one of these programs, does the program"
859,01:18:34.339,01:18:42.099,7.760009765625," fall apart? Or does it become a better program? And whatever the case, evolution"
860,01:18:42.099,01:18:49.099,7.0, is stating that random accidents in the precision genetic coding began to
861,01:18:49.099,01:18:58.739,9.639984130859375, accidentally spit out every direction and every kind of creature and species
862,01:18:58.739,01:19:06.219,7.480010986328125," on the planet Earth. Despite the entropy, biogenesis and all of Mendel's laws of"
863,01:19:06.219,01:19:13.659,7.44000244140625," genetics, and also ignoring all of these basic day-to-day observable sciences, one"
864,01:19:13.659,01:19:19.699,6.040008544921875," would anticipate that the evidence for all of these transitions, which would"
865,01:19:19.699,01:19:25.779,6.079986572265625," have to occur, spitting out mutant animals and creatures in every"
866,01:19:25.779,01:19:33.259,7.480010986328125," conceivable direction, should be readily available and easy to find within the"
867,01:19:33.259,01:19:39.819,6.55999755859375," fossil record. Strangely though, the evidence on the entire face of the"
868,01:19:39.819,01:19:47.779,7.959991455078125, whole planet Earth for all of this science-defying activity seem to be
869,01:19:47.779,01:19:56.939,9.160003662109375," primarily confined to this single set of monkey bones. Jeffrey Schwartz, in his"
870,01:19:56.939,01:20:00.819,3.8800048828125," book, Sudden Origin, stated, and I quote,"
871,01:20:00.819,01:20:08.659,7.839996337890625," Given that evolution, according to Darwin, was in a continual state of motion, it follows"
872,01:20:08.659,01:20:15.539,6.8800048828125, logically that the fossil record should be rife with examples of transitional
873,01:20:15.539,01:20:22.659,7.1199951171875," fossils, leading from less to more evolved. Yet instead of filling in the"
874,01:20:22.659,01:20:28.219,5.55999755859375," gaps in the fossil record with so-called missing links, most"
875,01:20:28.219,01:20:35.219,7.0, paleontologists have found themselves in a situation where there are only gaps in
876,01:20:35.219,01:20:42.939,7.720001220703125," the fossil record, with no evidence of transformational, intermediate, between"
877,01:20:42.939,01:20:51.580,8.6400146484375, documented fossil species. So despite just what Charles Darwin said in his own
878,01:20:51.580,01:20:58.460,6.8800048828125," day, that there is no evidence of species changing from one to another, and the"
879,01:20:58.460,01:21:05.780,7.32000732421875, fossil record working to further illustrate that animals stay within
880,01:21:05.780,01:21:12.900,7.1199951171875," their spectrums, not seeming to have fossils that change into one another."
881,01:21:12.900,01:21:17.979,5.0799560546875," Ben Eldredge stated in his book, The Myths of Human Evolution, and I quote,"
882,01:21:17.979,01:21:27.979,10.0, The fossil record flatly fails to substantiate the expectation of finely graded changes over time.
883,01:21:27.979,01:21:33.499,5.52001953125," Despite all of that, the fossil record and all of the sciences, let's go a tad bit"
884,01:21:33.499,01:21:39.859,6.3599853515625," deeper. Because one would think, if you were going to search for evolution, surely"
885,01:21:39.859,01:21:46.499,6.6400146484375, you would find it in the simplest of insects. Now it is true that since the
886,01:21:46.499,01:21:51.499,5.0," early 1900s, almost a hundred years now, we've been doing fruit fly experiments."
887,01:21:51.499,01:21:58.059,6.55999755859375," Tens of thousands, probably millions of generations of fruit flies at this point"
888,01:21:58.059,01:22:02.259,4.20001220703125, have been bred in labs and they do all sorts of weird stuff to them to try and
889,01:22:02.259,01:22:06.939,4.67999267578125, encourage mutations. They're trying to get them to have a mutation that has a
890,01:22:06.939,01:22:11.219,4.27996826171875, genetic benefit as well as pass it on. Basically they're trying to prove
891,01:22:11.219,01:22:16.979,5.760009765625," evolution. At this point, with tens of thousands of these that have occurred,"
892,01:22:16.979,01:22:23.539,6.55999755859375, the statement that arrives from the fruit fly experiments is that they
893,01:22:23.539,01:22:27.819,4.280029296875, appear to be immune to evolution. And they use the fruit flies because they
894,01:22:27.819,01:22:32.179,4.3599853515625," have short lifespans, about 11 days. On top of that, the flies are really"
895,01:22:32.179,01:22:37.219,5.03997802734375," inexpensive, they're cheap. In fact, was it not Morris Corry who said, out of our 400"
896,01:22:37.219,01:22:41.739,4.52001953125," mutations, there's not one that can be called a new species. Or Norman Macbeth"
897,01:22:41.739,01:22:47.059,5.32000732421875," who quoted, if a thousand mutations were combined all into one specimen, we still"
898,01:22:47.059,01:22:54.059,7.0, would not have a new species. So this guy here is a motor protein headed towards
899,01:22:54.059,01:22:59.419,5.3599853515625, the nucleus of the cell on these little bitty highways. Or perhaps you may
900,01:22:59.419,01:23:05.859,6.44000244140625," prefer Francis Hitching, hardcore atheist, mind you, who stated, and I quote,"
901,01:23:05.859,01:23:10.299,4.44000244140625, fruit flies refuse to become anything other than fruit flies under any
902,01:23:10.299,01:23:19.499,9.20001220703125, circumstances yet devised. He's battery charged by the mitochondria. Or just for
903,01:23:19.499,01:23:23.460,3.96002197265625," good measure, how about Gordon R. Taylor who stated, it's striking that geneticists"
904,01:23:23.460,01:23:28.580,5.1199951171875, have been breeding fruit flies for more than 60 years all around the world. Flies
905,01:23:28.580,01:23:34.140,5.55999755859375, which produce a new generation every 11 days. Yet they have never seen the
906,01:23:34.140,01:23:41.499,7.3599853515625, emergence of even as much as a new enzyme. And these guys here are little
907,01:23:41.499,01:23:47.219,5.719970703125, bitty turbines which are turning and they're powering billions of little
908,01:23:47.219,01:23:53.340,6.12005615234375, mitochondria batteries. But even if you find deterioration in the insects and
909,01:23:53.340,01:24:00.140,6.79998779296875," you can't find evolution in them, surely at least you could find some kind of"
910,01:24:00.140,01:24:06.739,6.5999755859375," improvements happening even in the microscopic world. Little bitty cells,"
911,01:24:06.739,01:24:11.299,4.55999755859375, wouldn't you think? And it's not just the fruit flies that they've been trying
912,01:24:11.299,01:24:15.659,4.3599853515625," this mutation thing on, mind you. Michigan State University evolutionary"
913,01:24:15.659,01:24:21.619,5.96002197265625, biologist Richard Lenski and his colleagues have searched for signs of
914,01:24:21.619,01:24:25.900,4.280029296875, evolution in bacteria. Single-celled bacteria now for more than 20 years
915,01:24:25.900,01:24:32.819,6.91998291015625," tracking more than 40,000 generations. And in the end, right now up until today,"
916,01:24:32.819,01:24:40.659,7.8399658203125, every part of the cell is doing a job that functions some other part have been
917,01:24:40.659,01:24:48.859,8.20001220703125, at bare minimum just lateral most in sheer volume. Degenerative. A fact which
918,01:24:48.859,01:24:53.799,4.94000244140625, caused University of Bristol bacteriology professor Alan Linton to
919,01:24:53.799,01:25:00.239,6.44000244140625," state, where's the experimental evidence? None exists in the entire history of"
920,01:25:00.239,01:25:05.479,5.239990234375, mankind more importantly the history of science itself on the entire earth.
921,01:25:05.479,01:25:15.119,9.6400146484375, There's not one experimental example to date of a cell mutating one single
922,01:25:15.119,01:25:21.719,6.5999755859375, upward notch of function or new improvement. And it's not for lack of
923,01:25:21.719,01:25:27.919,6.20001220703125," trying, interestingly enough. Where's the experimental evidence? Alan Linton"
924,01:25:27.919,01:25:35.799,7.8800048828125, continues. None exists bacteria with generation times of 20 to 30 minutes but
925,01:25:35.799,01:25:43.039,7.239990234375, throughout the hundred and fifty years of the science of bacteriology there is
926,01:25:43.039,01:25:50.959,7.91998291015625, no evidence that one species of bacteria has ever changed into another
927,01:25:50.959,01:25:57.599,6.6400146484375, despite the fact that populations have been exposed to potent chemical and
928,01:25:57.599,01:26:04.919,7.32000732421875, physical mutagens. The cell needs all of its parts to function. Those parts all
929,01:26:04.919,01:26:10.519,5.5999755859375, work together as a whole. If something comes in like a virus attacks the cell
930,01:26:10.519,01:26:16.439,5.91998291015625, or the cell mutates for some reason this not only can injure its chances of
931,01:26:16.439,01:26:23.159,6.72003173828125, survival but more than that can actually kill the cell can destroy the cell. It
932,01:26:23.159,01:26:28.719,5.55999755859375, has to be healthy and functional with all of its pieces doing their jobs. If
933,01:26:28.719,01:26:34.759,6.03997802734375, something comes in and interferes with that it doesn't become a better cell.
934,01:26:34.759,01:26:40.799,6.03997802734375," Alan continues, since there is no evidence for species changes between"
935,01:26:40.799,01:26:49.159,8.3599853515625," even the simplest forms of unicellular life. Is it not surprising, he continues,"
936,01:26:49.159,01:26:57.119,7.96002197265625, that there is no evidence for evolution throughout the whole array of
937,01:26:57.119,01:27:05.399,8.280029296875, multicellular life on this planet. That was Dr. Alan Linton. The biological life
938,01:27:05.399,01:27:06.399,1.0, forms on this planet
939,01:27:06.399,01:27:13.799,7.400000095367432, are not just comprised of little bitty cellular factories that are more sophisticated than
940,01:27:13.799,01:27:21.519,7.71999979019165, every single automated factory on earth combined into a space so small that you can barely
941,01:27:21.519,01:27:28.679,7.160000801086426, see it with our largest microscopes and then run with digital precision software.
942,01:27:28.679,01:27:36.539,7.85999870300293, But the inside of those cells are made of little bitty machines all doing things so
943,01:27:36.539,01:27:40.879,4.340000152587891, that you and I can even exist at all.
944,01:27:40.879,01:27:46.779,5.900001525878906, Was Dr. Doug Axe and Dr. Ann Goger that came up with these numbers here.
945,01:27:46.779,01:27:52.719,5.939998626708984," Assuming you started with your complete cell, your complete earth, and you've got your digital"
946,01:27:52.719,01:28:00.839,8.119998931884766," software running inside the cell, now you need coordinated mutations, coordinated accidents"
947,01:28:00.839,01:28:06.399,5.560001373291016, to occur within these strands on the DNA.
948,01:28:06.399,01:28:17.119,10.720001220703125, So to get six coordinated mutations to produce one new beneficial function on the inside
949,01:28:17.119,01:28:23.959,6.840003967285156, of a single cell would take 16 billion years.
950,01:28:23.959,01:28:29.999,6.040000915527344, Sixteen billion years is the currently believed age of the entire universe.
951,01:28:29.999,01:28:34.159,4.159996032714844, I didn't like their numbers so I kicked it way up.
952,01:28:34.159,01:28:35.559,1.4000015258789062, Why not?
953,01:28:35.559,01:28:44.439,8.879997253417969," The one trillion coordinated mutations, that would be almost enough for one earthworm."
954,01:28:44.439,01:28:45.559,1.1200027465820312, Give or take.
955,01:28:45.559,01:28:49.879,4.319999694824219," On this planet, which shouldn't mathematically be here."
956,01:28:49.879,01:28:57.159,7.279998779296875," If we were to speed him up, he's actually walking a lot faster than that."
957,01:28:57.159,01:28:59.279,2.1200027465820312, I don't know.
958,01:28:59.279,01:29:02.119,2.839996337890625, Just doesn't look random to me.
959,01:29:02.119,01:29:10.439,8.319999694824219, You know I'm thinking that the answers could very easily be a little bit larger in scope.
960,01:29:10.439,01:29:17.999,7.55999755859375, Maybe the history of the place might could bring some illumination.
961,01:29:17.999,01:29:19.999,2.0, This is Dr. Jack Horner.
962,01:29:19.999,01:29:25.759,5.760009765625, Now Jack was a technical advisor on the 1991 movie Jurassic Park.
963,01:29:25.759,01:29:29.279,3.519989013671875, He was doing an archeological dig when they found...
964,01:29:29.279,01:29:33.639,4.3600006103515625, The scientific world is still reeling from the discovery of actual Tyrannosaurus Rex
965,01:29:33.639,01:29:38.839,5.20001220703125, cells and soft tissue unearthed last week at a Montana excavation site.
966,01:29:38.839,01:29:46.079,7.2400054931640625," Now since that first discovery of actual soft tissue inside T-Rex bones, I've heard many"
967,01:29:46.079,01:29:55.759,9.67999267578125, many commentators suggest that to get the date of extremely alive looking soft tissue
968,01:29:55.759,01:30:04.079,8.32000732421875," like this actual image of T-Rex soft tissue on the screen right here, you don't want to"
969,01:30:04.079,01:30:10.439,6.3600006103515625, actually test the meaty looking dinosaur tissue itself.
970,01:30:10.439,01:30:12.519,2.0800018310546875, That would be a big no-no.
971,01:30:12.519,01:30:19.639,7.1199951171875, What you want to do apparently is test the rocks which are around the soft tissue.
972,01:30:19.639,01:30:21.719,2.0800018310546875, You don't want to test the soft tissue.
973,01:30:21.719,01:30:27.039,5.32000732421875, You want to test the rocks which are around the soft tissue.
974,01:30:27.039,01:30:32.639,5.5999908447265625," Well I mean, the elephant in the room is that when you're dealing with tissue that looks"
975,01:30:32.639,01:30:42.719,10.080001831054688," that fresh with blood vessels, then your animal is probably not 65 million years old."
976,01:30:42.719,01:30:50.079,7.3600006103515625," Here's how long living tissue lasts, and somewhere three or four football fields that way is"
977,01:30:50.079,01:30:52.319,2.2400054931640625, 65 million years.
978,01:30:52.319,01:30:56.599,4.279998779296875," You know Mary, when I was reading about this story, I was amazed that in some of the capillaries"
979,01:30:56.599,01:30:59.519,2.9199981689453125," when you went to pull them, they snapped right back."
980,01:30:59.519,01:31:01.879,2.3600006103515625, Are you amazed at the quality of these remains?
981,01:31:01.879,01:31:02.879,1.0, Absolutely.
982,01:31:02.879,01:31:04.879,2.0," 70 million years old, huh?"
983,01:31:04.879,01:31:09.279,4.399993896484375," It's just doesn't seem possible, but yes you can actually take the vessels and they do"
984,01:31:09.279,01:31:14.159,4.8800048828125, have internal components and so you can take a probe and kind of squeeze those things out
985,01:31:14.159,01:31:16.999,2.839996337890625, into solution and the vessels are fine.
986,01:31:16.999,01:31:19.799,2.8000030517578125, It's just I can't explain it to be honest.
987,01:31:19.799,01:31:20.799,1.0, Very cool.
988,01:31:20.799,01:31:23.079,2.2800140380859375, I have a lot of respect for Jack Horner.
989,01:31:23.079,01:31:25.899,2.819976806640625, Let me put this in perspective for you.
990,01:31:25.899,01:31:34.339,8.44000244140625, This man here on the screen released a discovery that he made which disagrees with many of
991,01:31:34.339,01:31:38.899,4.55999755859375, his own conjectures about dinosaurs.
992,01:31:38.899,01:31:45.779,6.8800048828125," You got to admit though Jack, despite all of the agendas or voices that may be out there"
993,01:31:45.779,01:31:54.419,8.6400146484375," concerning fossils, it's almost like somebody placed the bigger thing right in the palm"
994,01:31:54.419,01:31:55.899,1.47998046875, of your hand.
995,01:31:55.899,01:31:59.499,3.600006103515625," But in truth, it's not just the old T-Rex."
996,01:31:59.499,01:32:05.499,6.0," The soft tissue is being discovered inside of, for example, this 70 million year old"
997,01:32:05.499,01:32:13.819,8.32000732421875, Mosasaur tissue found or perhaps this claimed 80 million year old Hadrosaur on the screen
998,01:32:13.819,01:32:14.819,1.0, right here.
999,01:32:14.819,01:32:20.539,5.720001220703125, Look at how gooey and fresh that tissue looks right there on the screen.
1000,01:32:20.539,01:32:28.979,8.44000244140625, The list of these could keep on going and the truth is I'm not terribly surprised.
1001,01:32:28.979,01:32:38.779,9.79998779296875," The word dinosaur or dinosauria, meaning terrible lizard, did not exist until 1841."
1002,01:32:38.779,01:32:44.299,5.52001953125," Prior to that the name was dragon, meaning the big lizard that you definitely did not"
1003,01:32:44.299,01:32:45.739,1.439971923828125, want to run across.
1004,01:32:45.739,01:32:52.179,6.44000244140625, It's not just that there are redundancies of drawings of these things all over the face
1005,01:32:52.179,01:32:58.499,6.32000732421875," of the planet Earth, but there are thousands of writings about these creatures and sculptures"
1006,01:32:58.499,01:33:05.379,6.8800048828125, found everywhere from the smallest little bitty tribes to the largest empires.
1007,01:33:05.379,01:33:09.899,4.519989013671875," In truth, who could actually count how many dragon stories that there are on the face"
1008,01:33:09.899,01:33:15.379,5.480010986328125, of the planet Earth accompanied with drawings of the creatures.
1009,01:33:15.379,01:33:25.379,10.0," In fact, the old science book Historia Animalium claims that in the 1500's dragons, dinosaurs,"
1010,01:33:25.379,01:33:30.819,5.44000244140625, were extremely rare but were still existent at that time.
1011,01:33:30.819,01:33:32.739,1.91998291015625, You couldn't make this stuff up.
1012,01:33:32.739,01:33:38.459,5.720001220703125, Alexander the Great wrote about dinosaur dragons in India.
1013,01:33:38.459,01:33:45.859,7.399993896484375," Herodotus, the Greek historian from the 4th century BC, often called the father of history"
1014,01:33:45.859,01:33:52.859,7.0," itself, not only wrote about dragons but did a fantastic job giving descriptions of these"
1015,01:33:52.859,01:34:01.179,8.32000732421875, creatures and gave a step-by-step walkthrough of how the Egyptians would smoke out the pterodactyls
1016,01:34:01.179,01:34:02.659,1.47998046875, from the trees.
1017,01:34:02.659,01:34:09.539,6.8800048828125," Aristotle, Greek philosopher from the 3rd century BC, also gave eyewitness accounts"
1018,01:34:09.539,01:34:18.219,8.680023193359375," to these large reptile creatures, dragons, as well as descriptions of the flying lizards"
1019,01:34:18.219,01:34:26.499,8.279998779296875, similar to the thunderbird or pterodactyl head found at the top of Indian prayer sticks.
1020,01:34:26.499,01:34:34.419,7.91998291015625," Marco Polo, the explorer from the 12th to 13th century AD, gave incredible accounts"
1021,01:34:34.419,01:34:41.059,6.6400146484375, about large dragon beasts in the chronicles and records of his journeys.
1022,01:34:41.059,01:34:49.379,8.319976806640625, And we can be pretty certain that they weren't telling these dinosaur dragon stories as myths
1023,01:34:49.379,01:34:54.059,4.680023193359375, because we've got the bones for them.
1024,01:34:54.059,01:34:58.019,3.959991455078125," Complete with the gooey, fresh and soft dragon tissue."
1025,01:34:58.019,01:35:05.479,7.459991455078125, I could pretty easily be persuaded to believe that the person that drew all of these lines
1026,01:35:05.479,01:35:13.459,7.980010986328125, on this icca stone right here knew what a triceratops looked like.
1027,01:35:13.459,01:35:18.379,4.91998291015625, And here's a guy riding on top of a triceratops.
1028,01:35:18.379,01:35:26.779,8.4000244140625, Any man brave enough to hop onto the back of a triceratops is absolutely worthy of the
1029,01:35:26.779,01:35:30.019,3.239990234375, honor to be drawn on a rock.
1030,01:35:30.019,01:35:36.539,6.519989013671875, I think it would also be extremely difficult to convince the Asian cultures that there
1031,01:35:36.539,01:35:38.779,2.240020751953125, weren't dragons.
1032,01:35:38.779,01:35:46.019,7.239990234375," In truth, you could spend hours going through all of the inscriptions found all across the"
1033,01:35:46.019,01:35:47.779,1.760009765625, ancient world.
1034,01:35:47.779,01:35:57.859,10.08001708984375, And the amazing thing is how remarkably similar many of the reliefs are to actual bone structures
1035,01:35:57.859,01:36:02.979,5.1199951171875, that we find fossilized underneath the earth.
1036,01:36:02.979,01:36:09.059,6.0799560546875, Look at this enormous Chinese lizard grabbing hold of that deer right there.
1037,01:36:09.059,01:36:22.059,13.0," In fact, the Chinese zodiac has eleven regular day-to-day animals on it as well as one dragon."
1038,01:36:22.059,01:36:28.419,6.3599853515625," You know the real fascinating thing about dinosaurs though, they're found underground,"
1039,01:36:28.419,01:36:33.519,5.0999755859375, mixed in under there with other animals that we still see every day.
1040,01:36:33.519,01:36:42.519,9.0," So if I've got a real big animal that's on top of the ground and it dies, how does it"
1041,01:36:42.519,01:36:47.359,4.84002685546875, get buried underneath the earth?
1042,01:36:47.359,01:36:52.839,5.47998046875," If an animal dies on the surface of the ground, whether it be a giraffe, I mean it can't sink"
1043,01:36:52.839,01:36:53.839,1.0, down there.
1044,01:36:53.839,01:36:56.119,2.280029296875, I mean this is a real big animal.
1045,01:36:56.119,01:37:03.599,7.47998046875," Or a bronchiosaurus on top of the ground, solar dust can't fall on it."
1046,01:37:03.599,01:37:07.079,3.47998046875, How does something this size get down there?
1047,01:37:07.079,01:37:14.879,7.800048828125," These enormous animals are commonly found in mass underground dinosaur graveyards, literal"
1048,01:37:14.879,01:37:22.439,7.55999755859375," mass burials, as if the creatures were herding and whatever happened, happened all at once"
1049,01:37:22.439,01:37:25.679,3.239990234375, fast and unexpected.
1050,01:37:25.679,01:37:30.559,4.8800048828125," If it dies on the surface, it's just going to decompose and other things are going to"
1051,01:37:30.559,01:37:31.879,1.32000732421875, come along and eat it.
1052,01:37:31.879,01:37:37.799,5.91998291015625," It's definitely not going to sink down under the earth, become compressed and turn into"
1053,01:37:37.799,01:37:40.239,2.44000244140625, a fossil on its own.
1054,01:37:40.239,01:37:45.159,4.91998291015625," Now it is true that liquefaction would do that, I mean it would throw all sorts of stuff"
1055,01:37:45.159,01:37:50.279,5.1199951171875," underneath the ground, including your fossilized fish, your dinosaurs and all of these big"
1056,01:37:50.279,01:37:51.279,1.0, animals.
1057,01:37:51.279,01:37:56.319,5.0400390625, It would even divvy up your strata if you had water that was pumping around and loosening
1058,01:37:56.319,01:38:01.199,4.87994384765625, up the sediments of the ground and then you'd get your layers.
1059,01:38:01.199,01:38:07.839,6.6400146484375," But for that to happen, you would need an awful lot of water and these guys here would"
1060,01:38:07.839,01:38:16.559,8.72003173828125," settle into those different strata, pumping around on the surface of the ground."
1061,01:38:16.559,01:38:21.519,4.9599609375, This increasing pressure in the subterranean water steadily stretched the crust as a balloon
1062,01:38:21.519,01:38:24.039,2.52001953125, stretches when the pressure inside increases.
1063,01:38:24.039,01:38:31.639,7.5999755859375, Failure in the crust began as a microscopic crack that grew in both directions at almost
1064,01:38:31.639,01:38:33.519,1.8800048828125, three miles per second.
1065,01:38:33.519,01:38:40.159,6.6400146484375," The crack, following the path of least resistance, encircled the globe in about two hours."
1066,01:38:40.159,01:38:44.399,4.239990234375," As the crack raced around the earth, the overlying rock crust opened up like a rip in a tightly"
1067,01:38:44.399,01:38:45.399,1.0, stretched cloth.
1068,01:38:45.399,01:38:49.479,4.08001708984375, So the water exploded violently out of the rupture.
1069,01:38:49.479,01:38:55.759,6.27996826171875," The 12 stone tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest written epic in the world."
1070,01:38:55.759,01:39:04.399,8.6400146484375," The actual records of the King of Uruk, believed to be one of the oldest settlements following"
1071,01:39:04.399,01:39:11.439,7.0400390625," the global flood, which is one of the focal points of the entire document."
1072,01:39:11.439,01:39:16.839,5.4000244140625, Some of the water jetting high above the cold stratosphere froze into supercooled ice crystals
1073,01:39:16.839,01:39:23.759,6.91998291015625," and produced some massive ice dumps, burying, suffocating and instantly freezing many animals,"
1074,01:39:23.759,01:39:26.839,3.08001708984375, including the frozen mammoths of Siberia and Alaska.
1075,01:39:26.839,01:39:35.839,9.0," This is a Sumerian Kings list, which not only tells us about a worldwide global flood, but"
1076,01:39:35.839,01:39:40.639,4.79998779296875, also gives us a helpful hand with maybe the date.
1077,01:39:40.639,01:39:45.679,5.03997802734375, The supersonic fountains eroded the crumbling rock on both sides of the widening crack.
1078,01:39:45.679,01:39:50.999,5.32000732421875," This produced huge volumes of sediments that settled through the flood waters, trapping"
1079,01:39:50.999,01:39:55.679,4.67999267578125," and burying plants and animals, forming the fossil record."
1080,01:39:55.679,01:40:00.919,5.239990234375, Eventually the crack became so wide that the newly exposed floor of the subterranean chamber
1081,01:40:00.919,01:40:05.719,4.800048828125," sprung upward, giving birth to the mid-oceanic ridge that wraps around the earth like the"
1082,01:40:05.719,01:40:07.359,1.63995361328125, seam of a baseball.
1083,01:40:07.359,01:40:12.439,5.08001708984375," The continental plates, with lubricating water still beneath them, slid downhill away from"
1084,01:40:12.439,01:40:15.839,3.4000244140625, the rising mid-Atlantic ridge.
1085,01:40:15.839,01:40:20.599,4.760009765625," After the massive, slowly accelerating continental plates reached speeds of approximately 40"
1086,01:40:20.599,01:40:27.679,7.0799560546875," to 50 miles per hour, they ran into resistances, and like a runaway crashing train, they compressed,"
1087,01:40:27.679,01:40:33.199,5.52001953125," crushed, buckled and thickened, rising out of the flood waters."
1088,01:40:33.199,01:40:36.999,3.79998779296875, This is why the major mountains are generally parallel to the oceanic ridges from which
1089,01:40:36.999,01:40:37.999,1.0, they slid.
1090,01:40:37.999,01:40:43.719,5.719970703125, Today's major mountains were all pushed up in hours.
1091,01:40:43.719,01:40:51.199,7.47998046875, There are 277 flood stories from cultures around the globe.
1092,01:40:51.199,01:40:56.399,5.20001220703125," Some will argue that number is more like 2,000, but any way you cut it, there are a lot of"
1093,01:40:56.399,01:41:06.319,9.91998291015625," flood stories, including a man and his three sons and their wives surviving a global flood"
1094,01:41:06.319,01:41:07.959,1.6400146484375, on a boat.
1095,01:41:07.959,01:41:14.359,6.4000244140625, There's only one text on the face of the planet Earth that gives the measurements of that
1096,01:41:14.359,01:41:23.639,9.27996826171875," vessel, and that would most definitely be the Hebrew text of the book of Genesis."
1097,01:41:23.639,01:41:29.399,5.760009765625, Measurements given to us in the book of Genesis for Noah's Ark are given to us in cubits.
1098,01:41:29.399,01:41:32.999,3.5999755859375," You've got the Egyptian cubit, the Babylonian cubit."
1099,01:41:32.999,01:41:39.079,6.0799560546875, Now a cubit is thought to be the measurement from the tip of the finger to the elbow.
1100,01:41:39.079,01:41:41.079,2.0, So what is that?
1101,01:41:41.079,01:41:46.619,5.5400390625," For the sake of argument, I went with the lowest possible numbers for the measurement"
1102,01:41:46.619,01:41:49.119,2.5, of Noah's Ark and its interior.
1103,01:41:49.119,01:41:53.599,4.47998046875," Amphibians, well, I mean, they're amphibians."
1104,01:41:53.599,01:41:58.639,5.03997802734375," The survival mechanisms on many, many animals are just astounding."
1105,01:41:58.639,01:42:03.839,5.20001220703125," Did you know that certain types of frogs, like this wood frog here, can actually freeze"
1106,01:42:03.839,01:42:05.079,1.239990234375, in a pond over there?
1107,01:42:05.079,01:42:08.479,3.4000000953674316," over the entire winter and reanimate,"
1108,01:42:08.479,01:42:10.399,1.9200000762939453, literally come back to life.
1109,01:42:10.399,01:42:15.399,4.999999523162842," So the craft itself is 75 foot wide,"
1110,01:42:15.399,01:42:18.359,2.9600000381469727," would be 450 feet in length,"
1111,01:42:18.359,01:42:20.879,2.520000457763672," all the way to the end of that boat down there,"
1112,01:42:20.879,01:42:25.559,4.679999351501465," and it would be 45 feet, three stories tall."
1113,01:42:25.559,01:42:28.879,3.3199996948242188," So at its smallest possible measurements,"
1114,01:42:28.879,01:42:32.679,3.8000011444091797, that's longer than a football field by a lot.
1115,01:42:32.679,01:42:35.319,2.6399993896484375," Now insects will definitely fit on the boat,"
1116,01:42:35.319,01:42:37.679,2.3600006103515625," and there's no argument about that part of it,"
1117,01:42:37.679,01:42:40.279,2.5999984741210938," but when it comes to insects,"
1118,01:42:40.279,01:42:42.599,2.3199996948242188," they'll pretty much make it through anything,"
1119,01:42:42.599,01:42:47.599,5.0," or the larva, or hitch a ride on all of the floating stuff."
1120,01:42:47.599,01:42:50.399,2.799999237060547, Cockroaches will survive anything.
1121,01:42:50.399,01:42:54.719,4.319999694824219," Just like in Mendel's laws of genetics,"
1122,01:42:54.719,01:42:59.719,5.0, how many genetic lines of parent creatures
1123,01:42:59.719,01:43:04.719,5.0, do I need to create the spectrums and arrays
1124,01:43:04.719,01:43:09.719,5.0, of animal species that we see on this planet?
1125,01:43:09.719,01:43:12.559,2.8400039672851562, So this is roughly your layout.
1126,01:43:12.559,01:43:17.559,5.0," You've got 98% sea life, amphibians, insects, bacteria,"
1127,01:43:17.559,01:43:18.599,1.0400009155273438, and actually those numbers
1128,01:43:18.599,01:43:21.039,2.4399948120117188, would probably be larger than that
1129,01:43:21.039,01:43:23.599,2.5600051879882812, if you tossed in all of your different funguses
1130,01:43:23.599,01:43:25.599,2.0, and plant life as well.
1131,01:43:25.599,01:43:27.439,1.839996337890625, In comparison to the qualifying animals
1132,01:43:27.439,01:43:29.799,2.3600006103515625," that you would need on that vessel,"
1133,01:43:29.799,01:43:34.719,4.9199981689453125," which would be your land mammals, reptiles, and birds."
1134,01:43:34.719,01:43:37.439,2.720001220703125, The Russian silver fox experiments
1135,01:43:37.439,01:43:40.999,3.55999755859375, going on now for more than 50 years
1136,01:43:40.999,01:43:45.279,4.280006408691406," are one of the more beautiful examples of animals,"
1137,01:43:45.279,01:43:48.199,2.9199981689453125," in this case foxes, producing,"
1138,01:43:48.199,01:43:51.319,3.1199951171875," limited to their genetic kinds,"
1139,01:43:51.319,01:43:56.319,5.0, the array of variables and appearances within animal types.
1140,01:43:56.319,01:43:58.639,2.32000732421875, Look at this first silver fox here.
1141,01:43:58.639,01:44:00.799,2.1599960327148438," Now look at this silver fox,"
1142,01:44:00.799,01:44:04.999,4.200004577636719, as well as these cute little silver fox variations
1143,01:44:04.999,01:44:08.359,3.3600006103515625, produced within the 50-year ongoing
1144,01:44:08.359,01:44:11.599,3.239990234375, Russian silver fox experiments.
1145,01:44:11.599,01:44:16.359,4.760009765625," This is commonly termed as microevolution,"
1146,01:44:16.359,01:44:21.359,5.0, meaning that the species can work with preexisting code
1147,01:44:21.359,01:44:25.319,3.9600067138671875," within their animal kinds,"
1148,01:44:25.319,01:44:30.319,5.0, which is grandly different than Darwinian evolution
1149,01:44:30.319,01:44:35.319,5.0, where things are becoming other creatures and transforming.
1150,01:44:35.319,01:44:40.319,5.0, These animals are restricted within their animal kinds.
1151,01:44:40.319,01:44:45.319,5.0," Bottom line, this fox can have other variations of foxes,"
1152,01:44:45.319,01:44:50.319,5.0, but its genetic coding does not contain the information
1153,01:44:50.319,01:44:53.839,3.519989013671875, to turn into a whale.
1154,01:44:53.839,01:44:56.279,2.44000244140625," Actually, genetically speaking,"
1155,01:44:56.279,01:44:59.999,3.720001220703125, everything on this planet is losing genetic information.
1156,01:44:59.999,01:45:02.919,2.9199981689453125," This is particularly observable in viruses,"
1157,01:45:02.919,01:45:04.959,2.0399932861328125," but in all the creatures on the planet,"
1158,01:45:04.959,01:45:09.399,4.44000244140625," we're actually degrading, just like with entropy,"
1159,01:45:09.399,01:45:12.599,3.1999969482421875, and losing species counts.
1160,01:45:12.599,01:45:16.279,3.6800079345703125, The current numbers on extinction rate
1161,01:45:16.279,01:45:20.799,4.5200042724609375," are anywhere between 1,000 species a year to 10,000"
1162,01:45:20.799,01:45:24.319,3.519989013671875," between all of these types of creatures,"
1163,01:45:24.319,01:45:26.679,2.3600006103515625," and depending on whose numbers that you listen to,"
1164,01:45:26.679,01:45:30.239,3.55999755859375, but we're certainly losing things and not gaining them.
1165,01:45:30.239,01:45:34.439,4.20001220703125, And the same applies to our genetic coding.
1166,01:45:34.439,01:45:37.999,3.55999755859375," So, in theory, if you rewound time,"
1167,01:45:37.999,01:45:41.399,3.399993896484375," the genetic coding in the past,"
1168,01:45:41.399,01:45:44.959,3.55999755859375," further up this line, would be stronger."
1169,01:45:44.959,01:45:47.719,2.760009765625," Whatever the case, it was John Woodmarappy"
1170,01:45:47.719,01:45:50.319,2.5999908447265625, that came up with these numbers here.
1171,01:45:50.319,01:45:53.439,3.1200103759765625," She would need 8,000 genera,"
1172,01:45:53.439,01:45:58.439,5.0," actual couples or 8,000 family kinds,"
1173,01:45:58.439,01:46:01.879,3.44000244140625, to produce the spectrums of creatures
1174,01:46:01.879,01:46:05.999,4.1200103759765625, that we see on this planet right now today.
1175,01:46:05.999,01:46:10.719,4.720001220703125, That number makes provision for the extinction rate
1176,01:46:10.719,01:46:13.399,2.67999267578125," as well as, interestingly enough,"
1177,01:46:13.399,01:46:15.639,2.239990234375, he packed in all of the dinosaurs
1178,01:46:15.639,01:46:18.359,2.720001220703125," into that figure, by the way."
1179,01:46:18.359,01:46:20.919,2.55999755859375, So I went with the smallest measurements
1180,01:46:20.919,01:46:24.919,4.0," of the interior of the boat for Noah's Ark,"
1181,01:46:24.919,01:46:28.079,3.160003662109375, but now we're gonna take that a step further.
1182,01:46:28.079,01:46:31.679,3.600006103515625," Scratch out those numbers of 8,000,"
1183,01:46:31.679,01:46:34.759,3.08001708984375," times them by almost four,"
1184,01:46:34.759,01:46:39.759,5.0," kick it up to 30,000 kinds crammed in to the boat."
1185,01:46:39.759,01:46:42.359,2.600006103515625, That vessel on the screen right there
1186,01:46:42.359,01:46:47.279,4.920013427734375, could hold the equivalent of 522
1187,01:46:47.279,01:46:50.839,3.55999755859375, full-size railroad boxcars.
1188,01:46:50.839,01:46:55.839,5.0," In layman's terms, that would be 125,000 full-size sheep."
1189,01:46:55.839,01:46:58.839,3.0," Most of these animal kinds,"
1190,01:46:58.839,01:47:02.259,3.420013427734375," which again, I bumped the number way up on,"
1191,01:47:02.259,01:47:07.259,5.0, are nowhere close to the size of a full-sized sheep.
1192,01:47:07.259,01:47:09.259,2.0, It's a lot of boat.
1193,01:47:09.259,01:47:14.259,5.0," How many times does 30,000 go into 125,000?"
1194,01:47:14.259,01:47:17.659,3.399993896484375," And 30,000 is four times"
1195,01:47:17.659,01:47:20.779,3.1199951171875, what it's believed you would actually need.
1196,01:47:20.779,01:47:25.779,5.0," If you were to go with the largest measurements of a cubit,"
1197,01:47:25.779,01:47:30.779,5.0, this number would be almost double that.
1198,01:47:30.779,01:47:35.779,5.0, And this would be more than two football fields.
1199,01:47:35.779,01:47:39.319,3.53997802734375," From a sheerly mathematical perspective,"
1200,01:47:39.319,01:47:41.859,2.540008544921875," at the smallest measurements,"
1201,01:47:41.859,01:47:44.499,2.6400146484375, this boat will do the job.
1202,01:47:44.499,01:47:46.639,2.139984130859375," That's probably, bar none,"
1203,01:47:46.639,01:47:51.459,4.82000732421875, the most stable design of a vessel that you could have.
1204,01:47:51.459,01:47:56.459,5.0," If that ship were to go almost vertical in any direction,"
1205,01:47:56.459,01:47:58.339,1.8800048828125, it would still float.
1206,01:47:58.339,01:48:03.339,5.0, It's nearly impossible for that boat to flip.
1207,01:48:03.339,01:48:05.479,2.1400146484375," Proportionately speaking,"
1208,01:48:05.479,01:48:10.479,5.0, it might not have gotten every animal herded onto the boat.
1209,01:48:10.479,01:48:15.479,5.0," Anything not inside, when those doors closed,"
1210,01:48:15.479,01:48:17.839,2.360015869140625, might not be around anymore.
1211,01:48:17.839,01:48:22.839,5.0, You ever notice that sometimes animals just know
1212,01:48:22.839,01:48:25.239,2.4000244140625, that the storm is coming?
1213,01:48:25.239,01:48:29.339,4.0999755859375," And more than that, where the safety is?"
1214,01:48:29.339,01:48:32.299,2.96002197265625, How do you imagine they do that?
1215,01:48:32.299,01:48:36.579,4.279998779296875," Now we know what our ages of ancient empires were, right?"
1216,01:48:36.579,01:48:40.819,4.239990234375," We've got the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Babylonians,"
1217,01:48:40.819,01:48:43.819,3.0," the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans,"
1218,01:48:43.819,01:48:48.099,4.279998779296875, and then some would argue we're in Rome phase two.
1219,01:48:48.099,01:48:51.579,3.480010986328125," And these cultures, going all the way back to the beginning,"
1220,01:48:51.579,01:48:56.139,4.55999755859375," were building architecture that engineers, they marvel."
1221,01:48:56.139,01:48:58.059,1.91998291015625, And how can this possibly be done?
1222,01:48:58.059,01:49:00.139,2.079986572265625," Even with equipment that we have today,"
1223,01:49:00.139,01:49:05.139,5.0," the dynasties of ancient Egypt started at 2800 to 3000 BC,"
1224,01:49:05.139,01:49:08.699,3.55999755859375, where you see your first little beginnings
1225,01:49:08.699,01:49:13.699,5.0, of the empire of Egypt at dynasty zero.
1226,01:49:13.699,01:49:15.739,2.03997802734375," In this Egyptian king's list,"
1227,01:49:15.739,01:49:19.899,4.160003662109375, you see Seti and the young Ramses the Great
1228,01:49:19.899,01:49:22.379,2.480010986328125, was important to these ancient cultures
1229,01:49:22.379,01:49:27.379,5.0, to keep meticulous track of who was in charge and why.
1230,01:49:27.379,01:49:31.339,3.96002197265625," But looking back in ancient Egyptian prehistory,"
1231,01:49:31.339,01:49:36.139,4.79998779296875, they also had a flood story in which the Egyptians
1232,01:49:36.139,01:49:39.779,3.6400146484375, believed that they were descendants
1233,01:49:39.779,01:49:44.339,4.55999755859375, from the man who survived the global flood
1234,01:49:44.339,01:49:48.739,4.4000244140625, on a boat that had saved all mankind.
1235,01:49:48.739,01:49:53.739,5.0, It is at that 3000 BC mark that we begin to see
1236,01:49:53.739,01:49:58.739,5.0, the ancient world come to life in this area right in here.
1237,01:49:58.739,01:50:01.379,2.63995361328125," Little settlements beginning to take shape,"
1238,01:50:01.379,01:50:05.659,4.280029296875," the fertile crescent, Mesopotamia,"
1239,01:50:05.659,01:50:08.379,2.719970703125, between the Tigris and Euphrates
1240,01:50:08.379,01:50:12.099,3.72003173828125," and over here alongside the Nile Riverbank,"
1241,01:50:12.099,01:50:17.099,5.0," the first trickles, the tiny inceptions of our known history"
1242,01:50:17.099,01:50:21.539,4.44000244140625, start in that spance of land right there.
1243,01:50:21.539,01:50:23.939,2.39996337890625, That's what they mean when you hear them say
1244,01:50:23.939,01:50:28.099,4.1600341796875, it goes dark after 3000 BC.
1245,01:50:28.099,01:50:33.099,5.0, Anything after that date is a big question mark.
1246,01:50:33.099,01:50:37.819,4.72003173828125, 3000 BC is not just when you see your first settlements
1247,01:50:37.819,01:50:42.259,4.44000244140625, beginning to take shape and rise into empires.
1248,01:50:42.259,01:50:47.259,5.0, That's also the area where the boat that saved all mankind
1249,01:50:47.259,01:50:48.939,1.67999267578125, is said to have landed.
1250,01:50:48.939,01:50:51.299,2.3599853515625, The legend of Yu.
1251,01:50:51.299,01:50:54.499,3.20001220703125," After the great worldwide flood,"
1252,01:50:54.499,01:50:58.259,3.760009765625, a man named Yu surveyed the land of China.
1253,01:50:58.259,01:51:01.139,2.87994384765625," In the Far East, the Xia Dynasty,"
1254,01:51:01.139,01:51:04.859,3.72003173828125, the first dynasty of ancient China
1255,01:51:04.859,01:51:09.859,5.0, started its inception at 2000 BC.
1256,01:51:09.859,01:51:14.859,5.0, Many snakes and dragons were driven off from the marshlands.
1257,01:51:14.859,01:51:19.059,4.20001220703125, The peoples and lands of ancient India
1258,01:51:19.059,01:51:23.619,4.55999755859375, were divided up until the land was conquered
1259,01:51:23.619,01:51:28.619,5.0, by Alexander the Great between the years of 327 to 325 BC.
1260,01:51:28.619,01:51:33.619,5.0," And then at the point of Alexander's death in 323 BC,"
1261,01:51:33.619,01:51:38.019,4.4000244140625," you see the rise of the first empire of India,"
1262,01:51:38.019,01:51:40.459,2.44000244140625, the Murian Dynasty.
1263,01:51:40.459,01:51:44.779,4.32000732421875," That brings us back to our first empire, Egypt,"
1264,01:51:44.779,01:51:49.779,5.0, the place where the first pyramids would begin to rise
1265,01:51:49.779,01:51:53.979,4.20001220703125, at about 2600 BC.
1266,01:51:53.979,01:51:57.099,3.1199951171875," And our oldest written king story,"
1267,01:51:57.099,01:52:00.899,3.79998779296875," the 12 Tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh,"
1268,01:52:00.899,01:52:05.899,5.0," King of Uruk, called by some the oldest city in the world."
1269,01:52:05.899,01:52:10.899,5.0, Gilgamesh is listed in the Sumerian Kings List
1270,01:52:10.899,01:52:15.899,5.0," as one of the first kings following the flood,"
1271,01:52:15.899,01:52:20.899,5.0, living somewhere between 2700 and 2900 BC.
1272,01:52:20.899,01:52:25.219,4.32000732421875," From the land of Sumer in ancient Mesopotamia,"
1273,01:52:25.219,01:52:29.859,4.63995361328125," Gilgamesh took 50 men to cut down cedar trees,"
1274,01:52:29.859,01:52:34.859,5.0, and they were confronted by an ancient dinosaur dragon
1275,01:52:34.859,01:52:36.859,2.0, that they had to conquer.
1276,01:52:36.859,01:52:40.019,3.1600341796875, But it's after that that the story of Gilgamesh
1277,01:52:40.019,01:52:42.219,2.20001220703125, really begins.
1278,01:52:42.219,01:52:46.339,4.1199951171875, Gilgamesh would ultimately go on a journey
1279,01:52:46.339,01:52:51.339,5.0, to find one of the sons of the man who had built the boat
1280,01:52:51.339,01:52:54.819,3.47998046875, that had saved all mankind.
1281,01:52:54.819,01:52:58.139,3.32000732421875, Many historians believe that it was Ham
1282,01:52:58.139,01:53:02.499,4.3599853515625, that Gilgamesh referenced in his 12 Tablets.
1283,01:53:02.499,01:53:05.539,3.0400390625," However, it is important to note"
1284,01:53:05.539,01:53:10.539,5.0, that the use of the term son of in the ancient world
1285,01:53:10.539,01:53:13.739,3.199951171875, as is used in the Epic of Gilgamesh
1286,01:53:13.739,01:53:18.459,4.72003173828125," can also mean grandson, great-grandson,"
1287,01:53:18.459,01:53:23.459,5.0, or even great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson.
1288,01:53:23.459,01:53:25.539,2.08001708984375," But whatever the case,"
1289,01:53:25.539,01:53:29.820,4.280029296875, if Gilgamesh meets one of the sons of Noah
1290,01:53:29.820,01:53:31.500,1.67999267578125," about right here,"
1291,01:53:31.500,01:53:34.179,2.67999267578125, then that means that the flood
1292,01:53:34.179,01:53:37.500,3.32000732421875, can't be too far that direction.
1293,01:53:37.500,01:53:40.899,3.39996337890625," Commentators speculate, conjecture,"
1294,01:53:40.899,01:53:45.899,5.0," that the flood occurred at 10,000 BC,"
1295,01:53:45.899,01:53:48.579,2.67999267578125, and my question would be this.
1296,01:53:48.579,01:53:51.459,2.8800048828125, How come from this point here
1297,01:53:51.459,01:53:56.459,5.0, I can find cultures rising up
1298,01:53:56.459,01:54:01.459,5.0," into at least six different empires right in here,"
1299,01:54:01.459,01:54:05.500,4.0400390625," but on this side from here all the way back,"
1300,01:54:05.500,01:54:08.859,3.3599853515625," 3,000 to 10,000 BC,"
1301,01:54:08.859,01:54:13.059,4.20001220703125," that is 7,000 years,"
1302,01:54:13.059,01:54:16.419,3.3599853515625, and then all of a sudden out of the blue

1390,02:02:54.959,02:02:58.439,3.47998046875, Thousands would come to hear Jesus speak.
1391,02:02:58.439,02:03:03.119,4.67999267578125, And he's not recorded as being out there selling tickets.

1395,02:03:16.999,02:03:24.119,7.1199951171875," In many, many ancient cultures of the world, kings would sacrifice their subjects to underworld"

1397,02:03:30.479,02:03:34.999,4.519989013671875, Jesus Christ would be the complete reverse of this.
1398,02:03:34.999,02:03:38.039,3.040008544921875, Remember I mentioned the underworld gods.
1399,02:03:38.039,02:03:46.439,8.399993896484375, What greater love could one have than to lay down their life for their friends.
1400,02:03:46.439,02:03:49.519,3.08001708984375, The eyes of the blind opened.
1401,02:03:49.519,02:03:56.879,7.3599853515625, This is exactly what made men like the Pharisees behind the scenes unhappy.
1402,02:03:56.879,02:04:03.059,6.17999267578125, Under the cover of night in the garden of Gethsemane when the high priest and his soldier
1403,02:04:03.059,02:04:10.639,7.58001708984375, minions come in to get Jesus and Peter jumps up with the other disciples and he cuts off
1404,02:04:10.639,02:04:16.479,5.839996337890625," the high priest's ear and Jesus stops him and says,"
1405,02:04:16.479,02:04:22.999,6.52001953125," The cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
1406,02:04:22.999,02:04:32.639,9.639984130859375," Then, fascinatingly, the last miracle recorded by Jesus before that cross is to put back"

1408,02:04:37.159,02:04:44.879,7.720001220703125, This is the box holding the body of the high priest that demanded that Jesus be crucified.
1409,02:04:44.879,02:04:51.159,6.27996826171875, So I guess nobody's really confused about where he's at today.
1410,02:04:51.159,02:04:55.199,4.0400390625, And here's the tomb where Jesus was for three days.
1411,02:04:55.199,02:05:06.199,11.0, I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forevermore and have the keys to
1412,02:05:06.199,02:05:09.239,3.03997802734375," death, hell, and the grave."
1413,02:05:09.239,02:05:16.739,7.5," After being resurrected, Jesus got together with the disciples and with the people for"
1414,02:05:16.739,02:05:18.799,2.05999755859375, forty days.
1415,02:05:18.799,02:05:27.519,8.72003173828125," From the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, Jesus ascended with a cast of heaven's hosts."

1418,02:05:40.559,02:05:45.160,4.60003662109375, Nothing recorded is going on as usual.

1420,02:05:52.959,02:05:55.639,2.67999267578125, came out with a fierce rage.
1421,02:05:55.639,02:06:03.519,7.8800048828125," Ten of the twelve disciples would ultimately be systematically hunted out, tortured, and"

1425,02:06:22.959,02:06:33.040,10.08001708984375," Peter declined that offer, refusing to recant one single word."

1428,02:06:50.959,02:06:58.119,7.15997314453125," Thus, Peter would step out of this life on a cross upside down."
1429,02:06:58.119,02:07:05.439,7.32000732421875," John was actually thrown into a boiling vat of hot oil, survived it."
1430,02:07:05.439,02:07:14.439,9.0," Perhaps John's purpose wasn't finished yet, and ended up on the island of Patmos, where"
1431,02:07:14.439,02:07:16.479,2.03997802734375, he wrote the book of Revelation.
1432,02:07:16.479,02:07:19.079,2.60003662109375, This would only get worse.
1433,02:07:19.079,02:07:27.319,8.239990234375," Religious rulers, combined with the might of empires, would relentlessly hunt out to"
1434,02:07:27.319,02:07:30.999,3.67999267578125, persecute in a unified effort.
1435,02:07:30.999,02:07:36.040,5.0400390625," Anyone who knew Jesus, had talked to Jesus, spoke to Jesus, walked with Jesus, knew anything"
1436,02:07:36.040,02:07:44.280,8.239990234375," about Jesus, fed them to lions for sport, hunted them out to hang, crucifixions as far"
1437,02:07:44.280,02:07:51.480,7.20001220703125, as the eye could see to strike fear in any heart that would dare utter the name Jesus.
1438,02:07:51.480,02:08:01.240,9.760009765625," To keep you from ever getting one yacht or tittle of those texts, they failed."
1439,02:08:01.240,02:08:07.840,6.5999755859375, Those pages were paid for with buckets of blood.
1440,02:08:07.840,02:08:13.639,5.79998779296875," But after the word spread to the farthest reaches of the globe, they did the next natural"
1441,02:08:13.639,02:08:14.639,1.0, thing.
1442,02:08:14.639,02:08:20.079,5.44000244140625," Join them, and then go right back to business as usual."
1443,02:08:20.079,02:08:27.160,7.08001708984375," See, as long as you've painted a really nice cross on the shield, it makes it all better."
1444,02:08:27.160,02:08:33.959,6.79998779296875," Some even going so far as to define earliest scientists' heretics, which might play a"
1445,02:08:33.959,02:08:40.079,6.1199951171875, wee role in the contentions between religion and science.
1446,02:08:40.079,02:08:42.200,2.12005615234375, Let's take a look at the universe.
1447,02:08:42.200,02:08:47.040,4.8399658203125, You know the fascinating thing about heavenly bodies?
1448,02:08:47.040,02:08:48.120,1.08001708984375, They're very precise.
1449,02:08:48.120,02:08:51.280,3.15997314453125, You could almost set your clock to them.
1450,02:08:51.280,02:08:54.800,3.52001953125," In fact, we do set our clocks to them."
1451,02:08:54.800,02:09:00.800,6.0, Now the most predominant theorem on how all this got here is the Big Bang.
1452,02:09:00.800,02:09:06.040,5.239990234375," One of the things it's got going for it is that we can conceptualize it, right?"
1453,02:09:06.040,02:09:10.920,4.8800048828125, A big Star Wars style explosion in space.
1454,02:09:10.920,02:09:13.639,2.719970703125, But here's the fascinating thing.
1455,02:09:13.639,02:09:17.480,3.84002685546875," It almost doesn't look like a random operation, does it?"
1456,02:09:17.480,02:09:26.280,8.79998779296875, Everything that we're able to examine of the universe is based on a 3% sample of what we
1457,02:09:26.280,02:09:27.680,1.4000244140625, can see.
1458,02:09:27.680,02:09:35.160,7.47998046875," So I've got a big Swiss watch, and I can see its parts, but I can't see the mass that's"
1459,02:09:35.160,02:09:36.880,1.72003173828125, holding it together.
1460,02:09:36.880,02:09:48.880,12.0, So our current models of the universe are based on 96 to 97% of forces and mass that
1461,02:09:48.880,02:09:50.720,1.8399658203125, we can't find.
1462,02:09:50.720,02:09:58.720,8.0," In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was stretching."
1463,02:09:58.720,02:10:00.359,1.63995361328125, It's expanding.
1464,02:10:00.359,02:10:06.999,6.6400146484375, And we know by the redshifts that the universe is accelerating.
1465,02:10:06.999,02:10:12.119,5.1199951171875," Now before Hubble, there's only one other place I know of where you'll find talk about"
1466,02:10:12.119,02:10:19.160,7.0400390625," this business of the stretching of the heavens, and that would be in the Old Testament prophets."
1467,02:10:19.160,02:10:31.280,12.1199951171875," In fact, 17 times by my count, 17 times by guys separated by hundreds of years, all predicting"
1468,02:10:31.280,02:10:33.599,2.3199462890625, that the universe was expanding.
1469,02:10:33.599,02:10:36.840,3.24005126953125, Those guys just seemed to guess right an awful lot.
1470,02:10:36.840,02:10:38.039,1.199951171875, Talk about redundancy.
1471,02:10:38.039,02:10:48.919,10.8800048828125," In fact, Isaiah in Isaiah 40.22 managed to say that the earth was round and that the"
1472,02:10:48.919,02:10:53.359,4.44000244140625, heavens were stretching in the same sentence.
1473,02:10:53.359,02:11:01.039,7.67999267578125, You've probably heard it said by astronomers that they were shocked when it was first discovered
1474,02:11:01.039,02:11:04.679,3.6400146484375, that the universe was accelerating as opposed to
1475,02:11:04.679,02:11:11.399,6.71999979019165, accelerating. That's because this is exactly the reverse of what should
1476,02:11:11.399,02:11:18.359,6.960000514984131, happen if a big random space explosion had occurred. Shh! Don't tell anyone I
1477,02:11:18.359,02:11:25.679,7.319999694824219, told you this. But the 73% of the dark energy that we invented at the same time
1478,02:11:25.679,02:11:31.359,5.680000305175781, that we discovered the universe was accelerating is to fix the problem that
1479,02:11:31.359,02:11:37.999,6.6399993896484375, the 3% down here does exactly the opposite of what it should under the
1480,02:11:37.999,02:11:45.919,7.920001983642578," Big Bang model. It is he who sits above the sphere of earth, its inhabitants like"
1481,02:11:45.919,02:11:54.399,8.479999542236328," grasshoppers, who stretches the heavens. That's 1,600 years before it was proven"
1482,02:11:54.399,02:12:04.399,10.0, that the earth was round. But are there massive unseen forces creating that
1483,02:12:04.399,02:12:12.079,7.679996490478516, precise clicks of the Swiss watch that we call a universe? Oh indeed there are. A
1484,02:12:12.079,02:12:20.279,8.200004577636719, lot larger and it does not appear to be a random kind of energy. It was in 1917
1485,02:12:20.279,02:12:27.719,7.439994812011719, that Albert Einstein discovered the cosmological constant that he himself
1486,02:12:27.719,02:12:35.479,7.760002136230469, thought the numbers couldn't be right. But as we know today it turns out he was
1487,02:12:35.479,02:12:43.919,8.44000244140625, right. Well I mean he's Einstein. In layman's terms the finite construct of
1488,02:12:43.919,02:12:52.599,8.680000305175781, this thing that we call a universe and all of its majestic mechanical clockwork
1489,02:12:52.599,02:13:00.959,8.360000610351562, are fine-tuned to one part in a trillion trillion trillion. What I'm telling you
1490,02:13:00.959,02:13:09.519,8.55999755859375," is this. The finite precision construct of the entire universe, trillion trillion"
1491,02:13:09.519,02:13:18.079,8.560005187988281," inside which is the earth, which most definitely should not be here. Trillion"
1492,02:13:18.079,02:13:24.959,6.8799896240234375," trillion with the precision beings constructed of digital software, that"
1493,02:13:24.959,02:13:31.559,6.600006103515625," would be you and I with no spare mutating parts, that are consciously"
1494,02:13:31.559,02:13:39.279,7.720001220703125, self-aware comprised of cells that are more sophisticated than every factory
1495,02:13:39.279,02:13:46.079,6.79998779296875, on the face of the earth run by biological software. The cosmological
1496,02:13:46.079,02:13:54.479,8.400009155273438," constant, the fine-tuning precision of every piece of the universe is set to"
1497,02:13:54.479,02:14:03.439,8.959991455078125, one part in one with a hundred and twenty zeros behind it. On the other hand
1498,02:14:03.439,02:14:09.359,5.9199981689453125," this cosmological constant is tuned to one part and ten to the 120, a hundred"
1499,02:14:09.359,02:14:15.799,6.44000244140625, and twenty decimal places. Nobody thinks that's accidental. In fact it's the
1500,02:14:15.799,02:14:20.759,4.9600067138671875, cosmological constant that caused some physicists to come up with what they
1501,02:14:20.759,02:14:29.319,8.55999755859375," call multi-universe theory, sometimes also called Elvis theory, meaning that if"
1502,02:14:29.319,02:14:36.159,6.8400115966796875," you had an infinite number of universes, perhaps in one of those universes you"
1503,02:14:36.159,02:14:44.559,8.399993896484375, could have one where every single particle struck right every single time.
1504,02:14:44.559,02:14:50.719,6.160003662109375," Trillion, you've got to really want for there to be no creator. Pretty bad for"
1505,02:14:50.719,02:15:00.079,9.360000610351562, the multi-universe theory. Trillion and one part in that entire monster of a
1506,02:15:00.079,02:15:07.079,7.0," number. Yeah, it doesn't look random. No matter how you cut it, you're in a"
1507,02:15:07.079,02:15:16.839,9.759994506835938, finite construct. That in and of itself is powerful knowledge. Let's take a look
1508,02:15:16.839,02:15:22.519,5.6800079345703125, at the particles of that construct. Within the area of just physics alone
1509,02:15:22.519,02:15:27.839,5.32000732421875, there is probably nothing that will more quickly shove you into the
1510,02:15:27.839,02:15:32.159,4.319976806640625," metaphysical, the spiritual, and the dimensional than talking about that"
1511,02:15:32.159,02:15:41.119,8.96002197265625," subatomic matrix of reality. This is not a trite issue. That is the framework, the"
1512,02:15:41.119,02:15:49.439,8.319976806640625, actual particles upon which all of this sits. The paradox in every single piece
1513,02:15:49.439,02:15:57.799,8.360015869140625, of this place. Everything. It's not just that time and space dissolve into
1514,02:15:57.799,02:16:04.919,7.1199951171875, paradox. That's the wrong way to look at it. It's from paradox that time and space
1515,02:16:04.919,02:16:11.799,6.8800048828125, actually become. So this is the nucleus of my atom with a cloud of superposition
1516,02:16:11.799,02:16:18.119,6.319976806640625, of possibilities all poking up all around it. An ocean of little intelligent
1517,02:16:18.119,02:16:27.199,9.08001708984375, dots. The three-dimensional pixels of this place. A program writing in the
1518,02:16:27.199,02:16:34.959,7.760009765625, material world. Reality on its finest scale can appear like a majesty of
1519,02:16:34.959,02:16:42.159,7.199981689453125," little waves, vibrations of notes. But that can be deceptive because if one"
1520,02:16:42.159,02:16:49.119,6.959991455078125," were to dive a little bit deeper, it's actually made of little bitty dots. In"
1521,02:16:49.119,02:16:57.179,8.060028076171875," layman's terms, it's digital. It is not analog. Everything here in this place is"
1522,02:16:57.179,02:17:02.139,4.959991455078125, actually quantitized. The very frame fabric of the entire place. That's the
1523,02:17:02.139,02:17:09.259,7.1199951171875, term quantum mechanics. It's all in little bitty digital dots appearing out
1524,02:17:09.259,02:17:16.939,7.67999267578125, of seemingly thin space. Doing it so fast that it creates the illusion of something
1525,02:17:16.939,02:17:24.499,7.55999755859375, solid like this microphone here. To make up the fabric of the material world. All
1526,02:17:24.499,02:17:32.739,8.240020751953125, of it. The entire construct. The majesty which is even the finest little bitty
1527,02:17:32.739,02:17:42.579,9.839996337890625, pieces of the biology of this material world. Here's my ongoing music sheet of
1528,02:17:42.579,02:17:49.939,7.3599853515625, reality and here is my particle. Was Max Planck the actual father of quantum
1529,02:17:49.939,02:17:58.099,8.160003662109375, physics who discovered Planck time. That time moves at 10 to the negative 43
1530,02:17:58.099,02:18:05.339,7.240020751953125, seconds. This is not just the particle vibrating up and down or oscillating
1531,02:18:05.339,02:18:11.539,6.199981689453125, back and forth. This is literally the particle actually being the notes. This
1532,02:18:11.539,02:18:16.819,5.279998779296875, is what they mean when they say that the particle has no locality. That time and
1533,02:18:16.819,02:18:24.779,7.959991455078125, space dissolve at that point. It's literally appearing where it needs to be
1534,02:18:24.779,02:18:32.979,8.20001220703125, next. Matter is 10 to the negative 33 centimeters. Give or take. Beginning as
1535,02:18:32.979,02:18:38.059,5.08001708984375, children one of the first things that we learn is that time from our perception
1536,02:18:38.059,02:18:43.499,5.439971923828125, operates in a linear fashion. It only goes one way. You know one could almost
1537,02:18:43.499,02:18:53.499,10.0, think that time and the particle pixels of reality itself were actually
1538,02:18:53.499,02:18:59.859,6.360015869140625, connected. Imagine that you're watching a parade and here come the drummers and
1539,02:18:59.859,02:19:04.619,4.760009765625, the other instrumentalists and you're watching it one frame at a time from the
1540,02:19:04.619,02:19:10.459,5.839996337890625, ground. Just like the particles of this place that seem to be appearing and
1541,02:19:10.459,02:19:18.259,7.79998779296875," generated as we go along, so also is time. Correct? So time is passing. One"
1542,02:19:18.259,02:19:22.619,4.360015869140625," drummer person, one person stepping by at a time. So this is the beginning of an"
1543,02:19:22.619,02:19:27.899,5.279998779296875," event and this is the ending of an event. In fact, this could represent someone's"
1544,02:19:27.899,02:19:35.379,7.47998046875, entire lifetime. And imagine that you came up from above the parade outside
1545,02:19:35.379,02:19:42.139,6.760009765625, the construct of the entire universe. So you were outside time in a helicopter
1546,02:19:42.139,02:19:47.379,5.239990234375, above the parade. And you could see the starting area or the staging area. Watch
1547,02:19:47.379,02:19:52.819,5.44000244140625, the parade come around the buildings and actually see where it ends all
1548,02:19:52.819,02:19:58.299,5.47998046875," simultaneously. But you and I are not outside of the construct. In fact, we're"
1549,02:19:58.299,02:20:02.899,4.60003662109375, dead inside of it. You are never living in the past nor are you ever living in
1550,02:20:02.899,02:20:09.259,6.3599853515625, the future. You are always standing on the most crucial moment. The moment that
1551,02:20:09.259,02:20:17.619,8.3599853515625," determines everything. No matter when it is, it is always right now. Our body is"
1552,02:20:17.619,02:20:23.499,5.8800048828125, made of the same particles that the whole matrix of the place is made of.
1553,02:20:23.499,02:20:31.779,8.280029296875, With five little senses which we seem mysteriously plugged in to consciously
1554,02:20:31.779,02:20:39.939,8.15997314453125, control. Allowing us to poke around and examine the place on a finer scale. One
1555,02:20:39.939,02:20:46.699,6.760009765625, little frame at a time. You are always standing on the razor's edge of where
1556,02:20:46.699,02:20:54.339,7.6400146484375," reality becomes. In fact, you're helping define it. Now if the whole place is"
1557,02:20:54.339,02:21:03.139,8.79998779296875, comprised of little particle pixel guys in every square inch. Almost like a
1558,02:21:03.139,02:21:10.539,7.4000244140625, precise data live stream. That are not random and are appearing. Trillions of
1559,02:21:10.539,02:21:18.299,7.75994873046875, them creating even the tip of this pen precisely wherever they need to appear
1560,02:21:18.299,02:21:27.259,8.96002197265625, next. Moving at a rate of 10 to the negative 43 seconds. Creating in sheer
1561,02:21:27.259,02:21:34.179,6.91998291015625, unbelievable mass this thing that we call reality. But whatever's going on
1562,02:21:34.179,02:21:41.899,7.72003173828125, here is by no means a human hard drive. Little precision particle pixels in a
1563,02:21:41.899,02:21:48.739,6.8399658203125," pure live stream. And of course as the final touch, construct is interactive."
1564,02:21:48.739,02:21:56.379,7.6400146484375, Like intelligent smart parts within the construct. As if not only fed by a
1565,02:21:56.379,02:22:04.739,8.3599853515625, source but also each one being interactive. Which would indeed cause the
1566,02:22:04.739,02:22:12.179,7.44000244140625, particles to behave in the intelligent yet strange ways that they do. Come to
1567,02:22:12.179,02:22:21.139,8.96002197265625, think of it that would create time space and matter simultaneously. Wouldn't it?
1568,02:22:21.139,02:22:28.259,7.1199951171875, A woman came up to me recently and she said I had a dream and in my dream the
1569,02:22:28.259,02:22:38.179,9.91998291015625, voice of the Lord Yahweh came to me and he said for men of science who seek even
1570,02:22:38.179,02:22:48.739,10.55999755859375, the tip of the finger of who I am I have but two words intrinsic energy but you
1571,02:22:48.739,02:22:55.219,6.48004150390625, can call me dad if you like. I think I nearly teared up when she said that to
1572,02:22:55.219,02:23:02.979,7.760009765625, me. You know it's fascinating before Jesus Christ left he said in my father's
1573,02:23:02.979,02:23:12.219,9.239990234375, house there are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go that I
1574,02:23:12.219,02:23:21.019,8.79998779296875, may prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also. What's amazing is
1575,02:23:21.019,02:23:28.659,7.6400146484375, that this place even in its click click click declining state is so majestic
1576,02:23:28.659,02:23:35.420,6.760009765625, which leads one to wonder what lies beyond the particles of this present
1577,02:23:35.420,02:23:42.259,6.8399658203125, illusion. So every piece of everything here is not just playing little notes
1578,02:23:42.259,02:23:51.859,9.5999755859375, it's playing little specific notes. So let's brass tacks this out. What's behind
1579,02:23:51.859,02:24:01.259,9.4000244140625, the veil of this present illusion? The other side of the place where reality
1580,02:24:01.259,02:24:08.420,7.1600341796875, becomes. The only explanation which anyone could come up with is that the particles
1581,02:24:08.420,02:24:19.619,11.199951171875, don't just exist in our universe. They flit into existence in other universes too and there are an
1582,02:24:19.619,02:24:25.059,5.44000244140625, infinite number of these parallel universes. We physicists now believe there are other
1583,02:24:25.059,02:24:31.379,6.32000732421875, soap bubbles out there. There's no longer a universe. There's no longer a one world.
1584,02:24:31.379,02:24:37.420,6.0400390625, There are many worlds. Essentially anything that can happen does happen in one of the
1585,02:24:37.420,02:24:42.619,5.199951171875, alternatives which means that superimposed on top of the universe that we know of is an
1586,02:24:42.619,02:24:49.019,6.4000244140625, alternative universe where Al Gore is president and Elvis Presley is still alive. Do you find
1587,02:24:49.019,02:24:52.979,3.96002197265625, yourself agreeing with that concept of these multiple universes with many
1588,02:24:52.979,02:24:57.979,5.0, different incarnations and maybe ours is one of many different types of universes?
1589,02:24:57.979,02:25:06.499,8.51995849609375," You mean to ask me is Elvis Presley alive in a parallel universe? Yes! The answer is maybe, possibly so."
1590,02:25:06.499,02:25:18.299,11.79998779296875, I like it. I do. But I'm biased because I like Elvis. And who am I going to be to stand in the way of that man there having his own dimension?
1591,02:25:18.299,02:25:28.179,9.8800048828125," But, from a physics perspective of the multi-universe Elvis theory of the many"
1592,02:25:28.179,02:25:34.259,6.08001708984375," problems, there are three that come to mind fastest. Number one, with the multi-universe thing you"
1593,02:25:34.259,02:25:41.179,6.91998291015625, could not beat the dead horse into the ground faster and harder and completely
1594,02:25:41.179,02:25:48.299,7.1199951171875, kill Occam's Razor than you do with the multi-universe thing. Occam's Razor of course stating that the
1595,02:25:48.299,02:25:53.459,5.1600341796875," simplest answer tends to be the correct one. With the raw data, you're living in the"
1596,02:25:53.459,02:25:58.859,5.39996337890625, hours where you've got the raw data in your hands to actually look at these
1597,02:25:58.859,02:26:03.579,4.72003173828125," particles. Number two, of course, would be the sheer mathematics."
1598,02:26:03.579,02:26:10.859,7.28000020980835," nightmare, horror show of putting together that particular construct. You"
1599,02:26:10.859,02:26:14.659,3.799999713897705, need a new universe. If you're intellectually honest you need a new
1600,02:26:14.659,02:26:19.339,4.680000305175781, universe. Under the multi-universe theory every time a particle flips this means
1601,02:26:19.339,02:26:23.619,4.280000686645508, you need infinities of infinities of infinities of infinities of headaches
1602,02:26:23.619,02:26:30.699,7.079999923706055, more infinities of universes and writing it all out on paper. And finally number
1603,02:26:30.699,02:26:35.139,4.439998626708984, three last one that I'll give on that even if you went through all of the
1604,02:26:35.139,02:26:43.699,8.559999465942383, mental acrobatics they're required to come up with the multi-universe theory
1605,02:26:43.699,02:26:54.179,10.479999542236328, it still doesn't make time space or matter but I still really really like it
1606,02:26:54.179,02:27:01.699,7.520000457763672, because it's got Elvis it how could I not like it good work guys let's take a
1607,02:27:01.699,02:27:07.379,5.680000305175781, look at another one only conscious beings can be observers then we're
1608,02:27:07.379,02:27:12.219,4.840000152587891, intimately hooked in to the very existence of reality without us there
1609,02:27:12.219,02:27:17.259,5.040000915527344, would just be this expanding superposition of possibilities with
1610,02:27:17.259,02:27:22.179,4.9199981689453125, nothing definite ever actually happening if you want to see fear in a quantum
1611,02:27:22.179,02:27:26.899,4.720001220703125, physicists eyes just mentioned the words the measurement problem the
1612,02:27:26.899,02:27:32.499,5.599998474121094, measurement problem is this an atom only appears in a particular place if you
1613,02:27:32.499,02:27:38.539,6.040000915527344, measure it in other words an atom is spread out all over the place until a
1614,02:27:38.539,02:27:43.699,5.160003662109375, conscious observer decides to look at it so the act of measurements or
1615,02:27:43.699,02:27:51.019,7.319999694824219, observation creates the entire universe I like this one I really do a lot for a
1616,02:27:51.019,02:27:57.379,6.3600006103515625, number of reasons but I might suggest this if the consciousness does not
1617,02:27:57.379,02:28:06.099,8.719993591308594, create the particle or the material world the consciousness is a prerequisite
1618,02:28:06.099,02:28:13.259,7.159996032714844, for doing the measurement at all they're two entirely separate issues the
1619,02:28:13.259,02:28:20.619,7.3600006103515625, consciousness and the particle you're actually looking at the very fabric the
1620,02:28:20.619,02:28:30.259,9.639999389648438, place where reality becomes when you're doing your measurement you're looking at
1621,02:28:30.259,02:28:40.379,10.120010375976562, the first point where the particle is available for measurement so if I'm
1622,02:28:40.379,02:28:47.419,7.0399932861328125, understanding some of our current conjectures properly in the beginning
1623,02:28:47.419,02:28:55.339,7.9199981689453125, there was nothing nothing exploded and became sheer precision everything the
1624,02:28:55.339,02:29:03.259,7.9199981689453125, rocks began spitting out digital coding the dogs became whales the monkeys
1625,02:29:03.259,02:29:09.699,6.44000244140625, turned into people and as the final touch it's actually Elvis on the other
1626,02:29:09.699,02:29:19.099,9.399993896484375, side of reality I find myself strangely hesitant to commit to all that perhaps
1627,02:29:19.099,02:29:29.699,10.600006103515625, finding myself in more agreement with Max Planck the actual founder of quantum
1628,02:29:29.699,02:29:39.979,10.279998779296875, mechanics itself who said and I quote all matter originates and exists only by
1629,02:29:39.979,02:29:47.419,7.44000244140625, virtue of a force which brings the particle of the atom to vibration and
1630,02:29:47.419,02:29:56.299,8.879989624023438, holds this most minute solar system of the atom together we must assume that
1631,02:29:56.299,02:30:05.099,8.800003051757812, behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind this mind
1632,02:30:05.099,02:30:15.059,9.960006713867188, is the matrix of all matter that was Max Planck the actual father of quantum
1633,02:30:15.059,02:30:23.259,8.199996948242188, physics itself now in the ancient world they were talking about dimensions but
1634,02:30:23.259,02:30:29.299,6.040008544921875, they were not drawing Elvis in fact they were drawing strange things in the
1635,02:30:29.299,02:30:37.259,7.959991455078125, skies as well as biological creatures anomalies that puzzle us things that
1636,02:30:37.259,02:30:43.299,6.040008544921875, they said could step right out of thin air which is interesting because they
1637,02:30:43.299,02:30:50.859,7.55999755859375, were building architecture to their gods that baffles us even to this very day
1638,02:30:50.859,02:30:57.699,6.839996337890625, I'm not finding on their walls where they're talking about their gods coming
1639,02:30:57.699,02:31:05.099,7.399993896484375, from other planets they are redundantly talking about strange physical and
1640,02:31:05.099,02:31:15.699,10.600006103515625, spiritual beings as well as strange things that seem to occupy the skies
1641,02:31:15.699,02:31:23.179,7.480010986328125, some of it able to pull tricks that seem to defy even the laws of physics
1642,02:31:23.179,02:31:33.019,9.839996337890625, and deeper still things claim to step through momentarily not dissimilar to
1643,02:31:33.019,02:31:40.819,7.79998779296875, claims even right now today disturbing claims within the arenas of psychology
1644,02:31:40.819,02:31:47.819,7.0, claimed alien abductions things said to literally pop up not from space but
1645,02:31:47.819,02:31:56.259,8.44000244140625, right inside people's bedrooms shadow people body paralysis serpent snake
1646,02:31:56.259,02:32:05.419,9.160003662109375, reptilian creatures not dissimilar to the wisdom serpents throughout not just
1647,02:32:05.419,02:32:12.379,6.959991455078125, Egypt but the entirety of the ancient world Anunnaki the biblical sons of
1648,02:32:12.379,02:32:20.499,8.1199951171875, Anak or also called the Nephilim both before and after the flood as is
1649,02:32:20.499,02:32:25.779,5.279998779296875, recorded by the Sumerian texts you know when I think about it there are a lot of
1650,02:32:25.779,02:32:32.539,6.760009765625, things in the ancient world that have this sort of reptile cold-blooded twist
1651,02:32:32.539,02:32:40.539,8.0, serpent sort of a strange animal for a king to get his wisdom from don't you
1652,02:32:40.539,02:32:47.259,6.720001220703125, think and if one were to go from the lights that appear in the sky down
1653,02:32:47.259,02:32:54.939,7.67999267578125, through the fringe level stuff and then delve into the furthest regions of the
1654,02:32:54.939,02:33:02.299,7.360015869140625, occult the accounts only become more discomforting they believe that the
1655,02:33:02.299,02:33:08.859,6.55999755859375, tentacles of things that might be as close as the air between your fingers as
1656,02:33:08.859,02:33:16.379,7.519989013671875, you reach out into empty space and they built the largest temples on earth to
1657,02:33:16.379,02:33:22.619,6.240020751953125, things they believe dwelled in a dark realm in fact I would venture to guess
1658,02:33:22.619,02:33:28.659,6.03997802734375, that there are those right on the other side of this camera who have had
1659,02:33:28.659,02:33:38.059,9.4000244140625, experiences both light and dark that they might not share with everyone but
1660,02:33:38.059,02:33:43.779,5.720001220703125, when thinking about just things that seem to appear in the sky boy that's a
1661,02:33:43.779,02:33:48.739,4.959991455078125, lot of little dots out there isn't it then if the same type of activity is
1662,02:33:48.739,02:33:56.459,7.720001220703125, recorded from the very earliest parts of time all the way to present day one
1663,02:33:56.459,02:34:04.259,7.79998779296875, might almost think that the phenomenon was I don't know localized well if they
1664,02:34:04.259,02:34:08.059,3.800018310546875, were coming from other planets you would think we would sense the traffic and on
1665,02:34:08.059,02:34:14.019,5.959991455078125, top of that if you've got something that just steps right out into reality or
1666,02:34:14.019,02:34:20.419,6.399993896484375, just appears in the skies the question really does become where is it when you
1667,02:34:20.419,02:34:26.179,5.760009765625, don't see it in fact they were quite specific about where their gods came
1668,02:34:26.179,02:34:32.019,5.839996337890625, from not just in Egypt not just in Babylon cultures all across this globe
1669,02:34:32.019,02:34:43.899,11.879974365234375, believe that their gods were in the underworld hell shield Hades Tardis the
1670,02:34:43.899,02:34:51.659,7.760009765625, world of serpents in fact the beginning of many a king's reign began with the
1671,02:34:51.659,02:35:00.739,9.08001708984375, invocation ceremony the actual calling in from the underworld that the Pharaoh
1672,02:35:00.739,02:35:08.099,7.3599853515625, would invite the embodiment of the spirit of an underworld God to
1673,02:35:08.099,02:35:17.779,9.67999267578125, consciously rule from below through the mind and body of the Pharaoh himself on
1674,02:35:17.779,02:35:25.099,7.32000732421875, the empires above and it's not just the ancient world John D the head
1675,02:35:25.099,02:35:31.619,6.52001953125, intelligence officer under Queen Elizabeth the first did intense occult
1676,02:35:31.619,02:35:38.299,6.67999267578125, rituals and ceremonies with the full funding and backing of the Empire
1677,02:35:38.299,02:35:47.499,9.20001220703125, literally cataloging entire hierarchies of entities some of which looked exactly
1678,02:35:47.499,02:35:55.059,7.55999755859375, like what we may define today as an alien the official statement of the
1679,02:35:55.059,02:36:05.299,10.239990234375, Empire was that D was gaining wisdom from angels course after John D's death
1680,02:36:05.299,02:36:13.579,8.27996826171875, his diary told a different story repeatedly saying I believe they're
1681,02:36:13.579,02:36:22.379,8.800048828125, lying to me these things are not angels they're demons that was John D I'm
1682,02:36:22.379,02:36:29.459,7.0799560546875, quoting an occultist from present-day who stated and I quote if one were to
1683,02:36:29.459,02:36:37.419,7.96002197265625, peer into their world by portal of spirit you could easily perceive it as
1684,02:36:37.419,02:36:44.499,7.08001708984375, nothing less than a madness of monsters insects crawling over each other for
1685,02:36:44.499,02:36:53.739,9.239990234375, merely a breath be not deceived these things are highly sophisticated acting
1686,02:36:53.739,02:37:02.059,8.32000732421875, out their fantasies through the minds of men it is by this mechanism that an
1687,02:37:02.059,02:37:11.299,9.239990234375, invisible enemy systematically rules all flesh its best weapon being a single
1688,02:37:11.299,02:37:19.140,7.84002685546875, fact that most don't even understand that the patient predator behind the
1689,02:37:19.140,02:37:28.179,9.03997802734375, mask even exists and when you're dealing with the occult this side of the flood
1690,02:37:28.179,02:37:38.419,10.239990234375, all roads seem to lead to the ancient Empire of Babylon rising up at the
1691,02:37:38.419,02:37:47.979,9.55999755859375, inception of our earliest empires in Samaria and down here in Egypt where the
1692,02:37:47.979,02:37:54.779,6.79998779296875, wisdom serpents would begin whispering in the ears of Kings now when the first
1693,02:37:54.779,02:38:02.819,8.0400390625, name of the God is underworld doesn't that tend to mean that the God is
1694,02:38:02.819,02:38:08.459,5.63995361328125, already beneath you things that have already found their way into the
1695,02:38:08.459,02:38:16.099,7.6400146484375, recycle bin of reality perhaps the drainage canal for stuff that tends to
1696,02:38:16.099,02:38:25.739,9.6400146484375, bite the hand that feeds was Jesus Christ who said hell was never made for
1697,02:38:25.739,02:38:32.059,6.32000732421875, mankind I wouldn't have it any other way than to end this video with the words of
1698,02:38:32.059,02:38:42.899,10.8399658203125, John chapter 3 was when Nicodemus a wealthy Pharisee came to see Jesus under
1699,02:38:42.899,02:38:49.859,6.96002197265625, the cover of night so that no one would see and he asked how may one gain
1700,02:38:49.859,02:38:59.700,9.84002685546875, eternal life and Jesus replied are you not teacher of all Israel and yet you
1701,02:38:59.700,02:39:07.579,7.87994384765625, do not know these simple things does the wind not blow where it wishes and
1702,02:39:07.579,02:39:16.219,8.6400146484375, you neither see where it comes or to where it goes yet you know it's there I
1703,02:39:16.219,02:39:26.219,10.0, tell you so also are those who are born of spirit so do not marvel when I say
1704,02:39:26.219,02:39:38.059,11.84002685546875, you must be born again now in the Greek born again means born from above or more
1705,02:39:38.059,02:39:49.019,10.9599609375, precisely born from the place where this place comes from

1725,02:41:52.619,02:41:54.259,1.6399993896484375, Here's an article about the book.
1726,02:41:54.259,02:42:01.979,7.720001220703125," There's an image of me right there that was drawn by D Magazine, one of the largest magazines"
1727,02:42:01.979,02:42:02.979,1.0," in Dallas, Texas."
1728,02:42:02.979,02:42:03.979,1.0, Maybe the largest.
1729,02:42:03.979,02:42:07.179,3.1999969482421875," You can see there, and Mike Murdoch looks sort of angry."
1730,02:42:07.179,02:42:10.539,3.3600006103515625, There's me running with a safe from Mike Murdoch.
1731,02:42:10.539,02:42:15.979,5.44000244140625," So, if you're curious about that story or what all went down and how that could have"
1732,02:42:15.979,02:42:19.259,3.279998779296875," possibly occurred, you're in luck."
1733,02:42:19.259,02:42:20.259,1.0, Here's a clip.
1734,02:42:20.259,02:42:22.179,1.9199981689453125, Thieves by Trey Smith.
1735,02:42:22.179,02:42:25.539,3.3600006103515625," Amazon, Barnes and Noble, anywhere books are sold."
1736,02:42:25.539,02:42:29.259,3.720001220703125, I've been on radio and TV for 20 years.
1737,02:42:29.259,02:42:34.419,5.159996032714844," And Trey, first, as far as the book itself, I'll give you an example."
1738,02:42:34.419,02:42:41.019,6.599998474121094," My producer, Will Duffy, his wife, Danielle, was in the hospital to give birth."
1739,02:42:41.019,02:42:46.259,5.239997863769531," And they had some time, so Will is reading aloud Thieves."
1740,02:42:46.259,02:42:54.579,8.32000732421875," And not only his wife becomes addicted to it, but people in neighboring beds, neighboring"
1741,02:42:54.579,02:42:58.819,4.239990234375," rooms, all sat in to listen to Thieves being read."
1742,02:42:58.819,02:43:04.979,6.160003662109375, It's like Danielle wanted to delay labor because she was so fascinated.
1743,02:43:04.979,02:43:10.099,5.1200103759765625," Thieves was me pouring literally my heart out, day after day."
1744,02:43:10.099,02:43:13.019,2.9199981689453125, These were all written in a jail cell.
1745,02:43:13.019,02:43:15.579,2.55999755859375, And guards used to pay me when they were on shift.
1746,02:43:15.579,02:43:19.259,3.67999267578125, They would give me extra lunch trays to read them this book.
1747,02:43:19.259,02:43:24.339,5.0800018310546875, So Thieves was originally paid for with jailhouse lunch trays.
1748,02:43:24.339,02:43:29.699,5.3600006103515625," And then, after the safe robbery, when I'm on the run from a television pastor in Mexico,"
1749,02:43:29.699,02:43:32.619,2.9199981689453125, it really kicks into high octane.
1750,02:43:32.619,02:43:40.259,7.6399993896484375," Sometimes I would just stop and say to myself, there's not a lot of really great ways for"
1751,02:43:40.259,02:43:42.259,2.0, any of this to end.
1752,02:43:42.259,02:43:46.259,4.0," Crazy as it seems though, it did all end well."
1753,02:43:46.259,02:43:49.259,3.0, I promise.
1754,02:43:49.259,02:43:51.259,2.0, Thank God for that.
1755,02:43:51.259,02:43:58.259,7.0, I'm pretty certain that you're not going to find anything like this anywhere.
1756,02:43:58.259,02:44:04.899,6.6399993896484375, I wanted to tack a note on to the end of this video and state to you that that book Thieves
1757,02:44:04.899,02:44:12.539,7.6399993896484375," from start to finish, no matter how fun it might be to read, does not in any way represent"
1758,02:44:12.539,02:44:14.019,1.4799957275390625, who I am today.
1759,02:44:14.019,02:44:21.379,7.3600006103515625," And more than that, I've not only asked forgiveness in my own heart, but from a great many parties"
1760,02:44:21.379,02:44:28.139,6.760009765625, who are in that book and who are not in that book that I needed to ask for forgiveness
1761,02:44:28.139,02:44:31.059,2.9199981689453125, from.
1762,02:44:31.059,02:44:35.339,4.279998779296875," More than that, I'd like to give a special thank you to ministries, men and women of"
1763,02:44:35.339,02:44:40.899,5.55999755859375," faith, churches and organizations all across this United States, because they are not represented."
1764,02:44:40.899,02:44:46.419,5.519989013671875," The hearts of the people are not represented by the few that are just take, take, take,"
1765,02:44:46.419,02:44:47.419,1.0," take, take."
1766,02:44:47.419,02:44:53.539,6.120025634765625," I have seen so many, both great and small ministries, who no matter who they are, they"
1767,02:44:53.539,02:44:54.979,1.439971923828125, would give you the last shirt off.
