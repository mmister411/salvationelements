Everything from God to heaven to hell to time to space, when you hear the science guys talking about the theory of everything, we're not talking about the same thing. To dimensions and all that which lies between, from the cells to the stars to the quantum particles making up the whole, oh yes, we're going a lot deeper on this one. From angels to fallen angels to demons to devils to even the claimed dragons of ages past, to mankind's origin itself. Buckle your seatbelts. Welcome to the theory of everything.
        Copy



Now to really dig into this, you've got to start with the understanding that it's not just the universe. It's like this enormous Swiss watch. The living organisms in this place are literally made of digital codes, of mechanics that we really don't understand even the tip of the iceberg of. These are actual zip files, DNA strands to basically open like hyper-intensified life running all over the place to create every single life form on this planet.
        Copy



It's bigger than that. Let me put this in perspective for you. Everything from the fish and the plankton in the sea to the air that you breathe in, the oxygen from the trees to the carbon dioxide that you feed them back and return to the land animals that crawl on the ground. You and I right now while you're watching this video on the other side of the screen are on a little bitty blue rock that it's all also symbiotic in an enormous black abyss called space.
        Copy



Everything here is connected to everything else almost like a cradle that's for the infants. This is not just a few things work together here and there. This is sheer precision in every little piece of every part of this place. Systems built on systems built on systems. Genesis means the point of origin, the beginning, the inception, where what was not becomes what is.
        Copy



It even has its own little force field ozone to keep the atmosphere in. All making a whole. It is all connected from the cells to the stars. Isn't that awesome? Look how thin that is beyond imagination. They're sure glad that thing's there.
        Copy



The three greatest mysteries since the very beginning of science have been time, space and matter. The origin of one should explain the origin of all three. The Rubik's Cube puzzle of science. The Holy Grail. Let's take a crack at it right at the start of this video. The material world is comprised of the very fabric of the material world made of an atomic world.
        Copy



All of it from the air that you breathe to the earth that you're standing on to the planets. The illusion of reality and the stars above are all made of an atomic world. Beginning in the 1920s, the era of Einstein, Max Planck and these other guys, they ran into a serious problem. You dive right beneath that, which is comprised of a subatomic world, a subatomic matrix.
        Copy



And you're in your subatomic world, the place where the numbers go absolutely haywire. When they tried to pinpoint the exact location of subatomic particles, they found that it was utterly impossible. It's in fact at that point that you run into the scary measurement problem that we're going to talk about.
        Copy



Then you would think, if you dug all the way down to the center, that little nucleus guy right there that's floating loose, maybe he would be solid. Nope, same thing. Little dots all poking around so fast and boom, the spot where the paradox began. Statistical probabilities to make the illusion of the material world.
        Copy



So let's recap this thing, just to get a grip on what we're dealing with here. The quantum worlds are literally the framework of this entire place, the thing that we call reality itself. The foundation that actually makes up every single science of this place.
        Copy



So we're in an enormous black abyss of space on a little blue rock of hyper-intensified life and order. In the ancient book of Hebrews, it actually states a very fascinating thing. In the 11th chapter, the 3rd verse, it says, For we know by faith that it was with words of God that the worlds were formed, that what is seen is made from that which is unseen.
        Copy



Another translation of words is vibrations. As men speak words of sound that go a matter of feet and last only a couple of seconds. Perhaps God himself speaks substance. So is reality totally internalized into the little bitty universe that we live in? Or is the scope of things a little bit larger than that?
        Copy



Wasn't it Albert Einstein who said, those of us that believe in physics understand that reality is nothing more than a stubbornly persistent illusion? If that's true, then one might ask, where's the illusion coming from?
        Copy



To answer that question, I'd like to begin by taking a look at this little blue rock. The current conjectures in most all of science, the most predominant ones at this point, is that the entire place, including the universe right down to the earth, right down to the cells in your skin, the DNA strands and even the fabric in those quantum worlds is all a product of sheer absolute randomness.
        Copy



I'd like to take a peek at that. So if you and I are the amazingly intelligent fish within an enormous fishbowl, I guess my first couple of questions would be, how did the fishbowl get there and how did we get inside of it?
        Copy



In mathematics, anything that is 10 to the 50th power to 1 is considered impossible. It would be an absolute miracle. Just to give you a train of reference for that, 10 to the 82nd power is how many atoms are believed to be in the entire universe.
        Copy



Now it was Roger Penrose that came up with this number here for the odds of a universe that would produce one planet that could sustain life like the earth. So if that didn't bother you the first time, let me run it by you one more time again. Another impossibility, another impossibility, another impossibility.
        Copy



So let me tell you what this means."
        Copy



Right now, while you're watching this video, by any mathematical construct, possibility, another impossibility, another impossibility, another impossibility, you and I are sandwiched right dead in the center of a place that should not exist.
        Copy



And that's just where we start. And everything in the universe works together as a perfect precision of order to allow the existence of this little blue rock. And everything on this little blue rock are symbiotic relationships to allow us to exist.
        Copy



Everything here is symbiotic. It is all systems that are intimately dependent on other systems.
        Copy



So this is a protein manufacturing line within inside the cell. Like sometimes the key to exactly what you've been looking for is right in front of you if you take a second to look at it.
        Copy



This is not just a few examples here and there. Basically everything in this place is connected, no matter how loosely, to every other thing in this place.
        Copy



From the food chains and the underwater worlds, the land animals that roam on the ground, to the very cells and the skin and the fabric of this entire place.
        Copy



To get a DNA strand, you have to have the proteins configured properly. But to get the proteins, you've got to have the DNA strand.
        Copy



There is no chicken before the egg. And that's just one example of this.
        Copy



Many would argue that the entire place, the construct of the universe, right down to the earth, to the molecular fabric of your skin, is irreducibly complex from bottom to top.
        Copy



So entropy, one of the laws of thermodynamics, is that things deteriorate. They decline over time.
        Copy



It's not really complex. We observe this on a day-to-day basis; that organized things tend to deteriorate to chaos over time. They don't seem to improve.
        Copy



Now with humans, we engineer stuff and we try tug-of-war and fight with entropy and build better things, but ultimately systems decline.
        Copy



Our construct, our physical bodies are made not only just of particles (which we'll touch on and get into in just a second), but those particles: those little precision units of information (which is what Einstein would have called them), those little digits are making up cells which are as complex as cities.
        Copy



We're going to carry it to the nucleus of the cell which is going to open up and let RNA carry this DNA/RNA delivery system into the heart of cell.
        Copy



Have you ever noticed that sometimes to understand the larger scope of something you've got to actually go surgical for a minute? Get your hands right in mix: pay attention its smallest parts for just minute.
        Copy



Here imagine winning lottery every single day not missing once for next 10 thousand years you would still be nowhere close number odds one single cell just one little cell guy are: ten thirty-nine seventy one give or take now comparison last number looks really small right?
        Copy



In mathematics know anything ten fiftieth power one mathematical impossibility there ten eighty-second atoms believed entire universe so many times number fit number above answer trillions trillions trillions trillions number could keep going long long ways there's number atoms universe one against being single cell place went low ball numbers way now inside cell living breathing high performance no-nonsense no joke factory there's DNA strand inside heart cell these little machine guys come through here process called transcription these things size cities fact inner world cell larger inner world New York City all its little parts doing specific precision jobs then next set machines come through writing actually copying course like any factory all fits together perfect glove doesn't spare factory parts Every little piece serving precision role every other part within inside cell...


To starve as a complete piece, otherwise it wouldn't exist at all. In fact, if you took every piece of technology that we have ever made, packed it into a space so small that you could barely see it with our largest microscopes, you would still be light years away from the technology employed in a single cell of this place. And that single cell guy, he's dependent on other things that are beating the exact same odds, or actually larger odds, as well.
        Copy



See, he's dependent on things, and those things are dependent on things. Single cell is not just dependent on all of its internal parts, but it's dependent on the external world as well. Other things beating the same type of numbers, as if simultaneously, so that all of the parts can function, accident after accident after accident after accident, and those things are dependent on things, and those things dependent on things, and those things things of things of things, until you realize that all of it is dependent on all of it, beating odds just like these, for them to exist at all.
        Copy



Let me put this in perspective for you. Imagine you were that single cell, and you had just beat absolute mathematical insanity, and here you come into existence. But immediately you die, because all of the other stuff that you're dependent on, it's not in place. Just like the accidents were, I don't know, coordinated?
        Copy



Every living biological organism on this planet is constructed of little bitty factories. These precision factories are all doing sophisticated operations within the entirety of the cell. Each of those factories has tons and tons of parts that are all working together, doing these little precision jobs, but they're not doing these jobs on their own. These factories need sets of instructions, they need software. All of the parts of the cell are not randomly doing jobs. They're doing it based on digital coding, which is giving instructions to all of the machines. So the machines not only have to be designed to work with the software, but the software has to be designed to give instructions to the machines.
        Copy



So when you hear the scientists marveling, saying, how can this happen on its own? Why are the numbers this bad? The mathematical miracles happening all over the place, that's why the numbers are that bad. At some point on the timeline, order does have to occur, because we're here, right? Then it's about to get more intense, because the digital coding in your cellular factories is about to have to coordinate and come together.
        Copy



That gets you one single cell in all of the factory parts that are moving inside that cell and the little digital DNA software running the cell guy on top of the earth that shouldn't be there, in the universe that came out of nowhere. But this, right here, is the point where the accidents have to go sheer precision. That's a human heart right there, surgical. These accidents have got to be shoved violently into hyperdrive. Millions and millions and millions and millions. That is a very sophisticated piece of machinery.
        Copy



You do not want the digital instructions that are all coming together to create that guy. You cannot have trial and error, a little bit off this way, a little bit off that way would be a bad, bad thing. Have got to come together and coordinate of digital code all funneled into a pure live feed. Now all of the digital mastery has got to come together as one complete, creating everything from the bones being written in, to the muscles, to the ear, is where the rabbit hole goes really deep.
        Copy



The part where you need the master file. You need body plans which will coordinate all of that software to become that pulls all of it together into one majesty, a body plan. Putting together everything from the fingertips to the tongue to the toes and every part in between and mind you, you need a body plan not just for the human beings but a separate set of living instructions for every living breathing species type and kind of organism on this planet.
        Copy



And this digital code has got to be a lot more complex than any of our stuff. It has to be three-dimensional and configured properly because it's making three-dimensional biological organisms from scratch. Not only are there no spare parts, not just on human beings but on any other species of creature on earth. They're all a precision completeness. But more than that, unlike machines that we make like computers and things of that type, it can do redundant error correction to make sure that this comes out right.
        Copy



And unlike clunky machines made by man, it can self-heal like cranes and such that with time the part will wear out in the construct of the human condition. The muscles are actually designed to strengthen with use. A literal mastery of biological hardware. But it's not complete until, boom, you got your consciousness. Never forget the cherry on top. Right on top of all of it.
        Copy



Sort of like being plugged into Wi-Fi, huh? The real you and neurons and little connections coming down the spinal cord. It's almost like there's something larger going on here than mortgage payments and car notes. Look, here's the paradox. Let me lay it out for you. You can see the hyper-intensified order all inside. Every little detail of the place. But you cannot see the source from which that order comes.
        Copy



Even if it's dimensionally layered right on top of it. We'll get to that. The very spot within the life sciences where the matrix of all the little bitty fabric of machines and cells and parts that have come together to make the beautiful construction of these biological machines within the matrix of this place gets smack dab hit with the neurosciences.
        Copy



There is no point within those two sciences alone where you're going to run into the metaphysical, the dimensional, and the spiritual faster than that point to give all of these precise directions to the parts right at the moments that you think about them. Some kind of a point of translation. There's got to be a little bit more going on in there than just little electrical connections.
        Copy



In both Greek and Hebrew texts it refers to the human body as a temple that are zipping this way and that. Not in any random fashion, mind you. The ghost in the machine, the actual intangible conscious being that makes up what you call you operating through a physical apparatus of the human body. The intangible controlling the tangible.
        Copy



The very spot where some might argue two dimensions meet. Right here in Genesis 1:27 it does say that God created man in his own image. It's a bold statement.
        Copy



97% of your entire body is all self-functioning from the organs to the cells to every single part of your biological machinery. But you're calling the top shots experiencing the natural world through five senses. This is not a trite piece of business.

Every second you are taking hold and driving the whole machine by the reins. It's everything from moving the arms to where you're going to walk to your favorite flavor of ice cream.

How does something as material as the matter of the mind ever give rise to something as intangible as an experience, an idea, or the live stream continuum of thought, which you call you, is not little bitty.
        Copy



In fact, the neurosciences, which if you were intellectually honest about it, actually began in ancient Egypt and continue to this day. The tools and toys have gotten better.
        Copy



As Plato or Aristotle or philosophers all throughout the ages of time, even up until this very moment that you watch this video, would have asked, how does the non-physical control the physical? But the paradox is real.
        Copy



The mind-body duality, the split, the place where you have the blurring of lines between what they'll call dimension of consciousness and material world,in fact it's not just a blurring,fuzziness of lines.

That's exact point where physical and spiritual twist inside this construct.There are billions and billions and billions of neurons which are all acting with little synapses firing this way and that.

Scope than that, because it's not actually the eyes that see anything at all. The most advanced camera in the world, literally plugged in and tuned to the frequency of the material world. They're collecting the waves of light, which at their base are little quantified digital units, packets of light that enter through the eye. Solidness is an illusion. And when you're looking at something, you're actually seeing every color it's not. You're seeing the color that it rejects. But it's not just about the color of something.
        Copy



If you were to really look at reality, the way that it is, it's comprised of zipping little digits, quantized units, 99.9% empty space. Was Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr, who, mind you, gave us an actual model of the atom, who stated, and I quote, those who are not shocked by quantum mechanics have not yet understood it. The fabric of this place, the little data points making up the material world, but it's sufficient at this point to simply understand that what you're looking at is data coming in through the eye, going down the optic nerve, translating into images, and then hits your consciousness, the intangible part of you, plugged in right now, real time, live stream all the time, which is calling the shots on the whole show.
        Copy



This very much implies that the real you is much more than the software, the hardware, the biological machine. It does seem like there's a little bit more going on here than what meets the eye. Let me ask you this: if your consciousness is separate from your physical body, and your physical body dies, then that would have to mean that you still exist, right? Let that one sink in a minute.
        Copy



Now in the Greek text of Romans 12.2, it says something fascinating: it says, be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Now when I think about transformed, I sort of think about a caterpillar in this cocoon state. And I'll tell you, when the caterpillar goes into that cocoon, it becomes literally a black goo. It loses all body form inside that cocoon and completely changes. How could the caterpillar ever imagine becoming what it was literally born to become?
        Copy



Sometimes I'll hear physicists say that the universe is really large. My first thought is, compared to what? And we don't know how it does it. How could a body form literally change into something else? Something that beautiful, but yet it does it, as if it's built right in to the program itself.
        Copy



Imagine for a moment that you were a sperm cell, just a little bitty cell. And here you are, and you're headed towards the egg. And imagine that you're conscious, and there is no way you could possibly ever imagine what it was that you were born to become. How could it possibly know that it was about to go from its little bitty tiny world to one beyond imagination?
        Copy



Now as that sperm cell, you could easily look at other sperm cells that have gone over into a corner or some place where they've sort of gathered over here or over here. You could easily get scared or sidetracked; it's a big place. Or you can come into perfect alignment with what you're designed to become. Imagine straight up keeping your eyes on the prize of that egg, going straight forward and by that mechanism become a victor born to emerge.
        Copy



By the way, even despite the larger scope, which we're going to look at, that does mean that you were a winner at the very start of this thing. No matter how you cut it, that right there is God's greatest gift of a birthday present. You don't get to pick it from the start, but you do get to decide what you're going to do with it, and what voices you're going to listen to.
        Copy



The gatekeeper against, shall we say, any little pushy things? Before we can go larger in scope and look at the full scale of what we're dealing with, I'd like to take a peek at evolution, which states that all of this that we've just discussed came out of sheer randomness. This is important because these are two entirely different paths. One, the evolution, we just keep getting lucky, lot-to-lot win after lotto win. But bottom line, random accidents keep mysteriously hitting lotto wins, and it's all internalized. What you see is what you get?
        Copy



And science and the disconnect possibly between the two of them. Or it's larger in scope and precision information has a source. The definition of science actually is the study of the material and physical world and universe based on observation, experimentation and investigation. So let's investigate it.
        Copy



So right from the beginning of this thing we're going to give evolution some really big head starts beginning with the universe itself. At first glance the universe can sort of look like maybe it's a random place but in fact we have known for a long time now that the universe is very far from random. This is commonly termed as the anthropic principle.
        Copy



In fact more than that if you were to really look at physics of this place you'd find 1% off this way 1% off that way is a bad bad thing. You and I would not be talking at all.
        Copy



Anthropic means that it has to be exactly the way that it is for us to exist. More than that when it comes to say the cosmological constant you wouldn't even find an atheist physicist who would tell you that they believe that one was accidental. The fine-tuning of the universe is not a little bitty issue but nonetheless we're going to start with the whole package.
        Copy



Evolution gets the universe the whole construct and shebang with all its precision from beginning for free and within inside of that universe we're throwing in earth as well. Don't worry about big number there and all of those impossibilities we're tossing it into package for free for evolution as well.
        Copy



Evolution does also appear to defy entropy second law of thermodynamics that things decline over time we see species go extinct we don't have one recorded example of new species ever becoming but we do have plenty examples of species going away dinosaurs would be an example of that so it violates entropy but don't worry we're going to go ahead give evolution a free pass on that one as well for purpose of this.
        Copy



It is truth evolution also violates biogenesis which states of course life only comes from other life evolutionist Sir Fred Hoyle stated and I quote believing first cell arriving by chance and accident like believing tornado could sweep through junkyard create Boeing 747 It's not just species we don't see becoming but cellular level never seen cell come from anything other than another cell now just like entropy we see cells go away we see them mutate and die but never see cell become
        Copy



Just like cell we've also never seen DNA strand come on its own digital coding for life any kind life even smallest form life we've never seen digital coding become that's another problem  need both simultaneously but purpose this doing it gets cell gets coding both combined from start so I need digital coding for life happen from inorganic materials somehow whether be Moses sort volcano did or others proposed lightning struck produced digital coding or if want view that things were shaking around sort cosmic soup
        Copy



By some mechanism I need actual sophisticated code tens tens tens thousands times more advanced than this laptop entire computer setup combined in every single strand can't have any junk code there It's got be tit for tat on every line because digital software making up living instructions click by click line by line for life itself
        Copy



But even though three-dimensional digital coding for just one single strand DNA really incredibly complex for us that's just where begins get tough because now I've got have trillions trillions strands digital software come together perfect glove coordinating each precision piece create little fingers little arms little legs little toes then need different kinds software all come together every kind tissue nervous system all functionality including human mind itself
        Copy



Every organ every cell every system all built comprised pulled together from digital software including billions neurons make up brain then final touch need miracle miracles itself consciousness does sort seem awful lot mysterious accidents

Earth and watered the face of the ground. If we were intellectually honest about it, the symbiotic relationships that we would need, particularly for the biological stuff in a single cell to exist in this place, would be trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of things when we really began to poke through and see how many things was actually dependent on. And to be intellectually more honest about it, it would probably turn out to be the entirety of all of the systems on the earth itself, or a significant portion of those systems. But just to keep this simple for this test of evolution, we're going to toss all of that stuff out of the mix.
        Copy



In Genesis 1:11, it states, God said, let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind. Single cell, again, the odds of one cell in this place are 10 to the 39,970 to 1. For one single cell, of course, anything over 10 to the 50th power in mathematics is considered absolutely absurd. They're believed to be 10 to the 82nd power atoms in the entirety of the universe. But for the purpose of this, we're going to have to, at bare minimum, give our test the symbiotic relationship of at least the plants. And tree yielding fruit whose seed was already in itself after his kind also. And God saw that it was good.
        Copy



We definitely need the plants because we're breathing oxygen in. These plants are really, really critical. Now we need many, many things that are beating those same odds coming into existence simultaneously, like these guys here. And if we were to actually take a deep look into the plants, we're going to find that the systems for the plants that are running the seeds are symbiotic systems as well. You don't get the plant without the seed. And the seed, mind you, is a biological program as well. It's got all of the coding intact with no spare coating to make a plant or a tree.
        Copy



It's got to have all of its little parts doing all of their little jobs from the start. But nonetheless, for the purpose of this test, it gets the cell, it gets the seeds, it gets the trees, it gets the coating, it gets to violate the entropy, which we observe every single day that things decline over time, not improve. You and I are also going to give it a free pass on all of the lotto wins that it's got to redundantly win.

We're going to give it as many of those as it needs time and time again for the purpose of this test, as well as allowing it to ignore all of the symbiotic relationships, which would have to develop simultaneously. There's another real big one that we're going to have to kick out of the mix. Mendel's Laws of Genetics. Sort of a large third strike, as well as their modern day refinements. It's not like we just started studying genetics yesterday.
        Copy



We're talking about biological software. I hate to even compare DNA strands to any of our stuff. For example, DNA uses 4-bit code. Our computer software uses 2-bit binary code: little 1's and little 0's. This is 4-bit. This is 3-dimensional. Each different type of strand of genetic software, the odds against it existing are 1 in 48, with 48 0's behind it. So that's 1 in 48 octillion to 1 against each piece of digital software existing at all.
        Copy



The programming software has got to work seamlessly with these cellular factories, which in their inner worlds are more tit-for-tat precise, more efficient than any computerized automated factories on planet Earth. The list of these things could keep on going. DNA is the literal software. The living programming, line-by-line specific for every single cute, soft, warm, and cuddly thing—even the strangest of things.
        Copy



Bottom line: DNA is the software which makes up all of the different types and kinds of species on this planet. Each creature has exactly the coding that it needs to become whatever type, kind, or species of creature that it is. There is no junk code in DNA, nor is there junk code in the cells which the DNA software runs inside of or in the organs which those cells make up, or in the entire functional systems of living biological organisms themselves.
        Copy



Every type of creature has exactly the same code. Every creature has zero mutating parts on its body that would hinder its chances for survival. If it had things mutating, even worse: if it gets any type of genetic defect or mutation, any type of randomness introduced into this precision line-by-line coding can not only injure the creature but can kill it.
        Copy



That's all just the baseline stuff. If we were to leave Mendel's laws of genetics into this test of evolution, that would—let's just say—it kicks up the toughness for this guy here another few trillion notches.
        Copy



The genetic software that makes up a bunny rabbit is entirely different from that which makes up a turtle. The two cannot mate; it is a software disconnect. When you're dealing with biological software—just like dealing with regular software—programming and coding has to match up line for line. Different programs have different coding and they're only designed to work with specifically compatible coding.
        Copy



The genetic coding—the actual digital software—has to match up line for line for line with each program. The genetic coding inherent in dogs (at least naturally without any engineering done, any intelligence intervention, or any tampering with the code) will only work or produce other breeds and kinds of dogs. It's only compatible with other dog types.
        Copy



Mendel's laws of genetics apply to every species type on this planet. There are specific body plans from the smallest little things that creep and crawl to the largest creatures on planet Earth. The same thing applies with horses and those that breed horses; the genetic code inherent in these creatures is only compatible and can only produce other breeds of horses by any natural cause.
        Copy



These genetic laws are particularly important when you're dealing with animals that look very similar (if not identical) in many ways. They may even have parts within their bodies that are absolutely identical to one another—appearances can be deceiving. Just like if you had two separate factories with similar or identical machines in each one yet both factories are running different genetic software.
        Copy



You've probably heard it said that horses—or animals like horses—wanted to reach tree branches way up high so over time horses grew longer and longer necks so they could get at those taller branches eventually becoming giraffes. The truth is that the genetic coding for a giraffe and its biological systems are not even remotely close to those systems found in any type of horse.
        Copy



Just like with computer software: you need a source for every single line of code; coding does not grow—it does not magically appear—whether it be biological coding or computer coding. And if you're missing code or any digits are off your system crashes—your animal is in trouble.
        Copy



This isn't just wishful thinking; I want to click up a larger neck; this is real— you need actual line-by-line precision digital coding for every cell every function every part. All down the neck of this animal are blood vessels and arteries which have valves requiring more walls of digital coding that will shut off and keep animal blood so when it goes down for water it will not pass out risking its survival chances.
        Copy



If it's trying to run or get away passing out risks drowning or if just going down for water causes unconsciousness risking its life again taking special sponge-like material on its mind requiring more software for safe drinking routines minimizing pass-out chances.

On this planet as well as every single living breathing creature on the face of the planet Earth. It's a lot of lightning bolts. In the construct of this place, the matrix of the material world, this thing that we call reality, the entirety of little particles which make up the universe.
        Copy



Everything here is a causality, a cause and an effect. This becomes particularly important in science when you can see the effect of something but you cannot see the larger scale of what caused it. You know it's also true that a created thing can never understand the scope of what created it. At the inception of the book of Genesis it starts with a fascinating statement. It says, in the beginning the God of gods, Yahweh, created everything.
        Copy



Now the use of the word God in the Hebrew, in that sentence, Yahweh means something a lot larger in scope than Zeus or a man in the clouds with a lightning bolt. It's actually stating in the text that our dad is larger and more unimaginable in scope than the construct of every single three-dimensional particle pixel in the quantum live feed of little dots making up the precision framework of this present illusion, the fabric of the entire place.
        Copy



The text goes on to say and the earth was without form and void. Now in the original Hebrew that sentence actually reads and the earth had become without form and void as if to indicate that the place itself, the entire construct is older than where our story begins. It goes on to say and darkness was on the face of the deep.
        Copy



Now many, many commentators have speculated on that passage that it's talking about the water and the oceans and that is a possibility. What's interesting is that the word darkness is a very, very heavy metaphor word. You know I'm wondering if the text is referring to just regular darkness or if it's referencing something a little deeper than that. And the word waters or celestial waters in every ancient culture meant the entirety of the universe, the place where the stars are.
        Copy



So it states and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light. Now the word light is another extremely heavy metaphor word and God saw that the light was good and God divided the light from the darkness. What's funny is that even as a human and designing something on a computer per se, what I'll do when I begin a new project is I'll separate my old stuff from my new stuff and make a clean slate.
        Copy



It's at that point in the text that you begin with your dramatic rise in order in the place itself. This systematic rise almost as systematic and step-by-step precise as the order which rises when a DNA strand opens to become a living, breathing life form.
        Copy



Whatever the case let's swim a little further upstream and see if we can't get our head up above the water. It is true that inorganic material no matter how much you shake it or cosmic soup it does not generally start spitting out digital coding. Even dealing with the smallest little microbes on the face of the planet Earth like this little virus of E. coli that I've got going on the screen right here.
        Copy



The software has got to be a pre-programmed match on every line just like in a computer program and they can only interbreed within their kind. Like viruses do lateral gene transfers just as dogs and other animals can only mate within or share genes within their specific track of animals. Turtles with turtles, bunny rabbits with bunny rabbits.
        Copy



Bottom line whether you're dealing with the littlest bug, the largest buffalo or the pristine pinnacle of human life itself. You are gonna need the source code. Tuck the fact that I brought up viruses into the back your mind. Little bitty guys that like to come into a cell like a little bitty missile and convince the host that their voice is the one that the cell should be listening to before they crawl in there and create a tumor or a cancer and add their code to the mix.
        Copy



Just like what happens on computer software when a virus wiggles its way in. Perhaps also when arriving at the dimensional scope of things you not only have larger scale issues but perhaps as well there are little buggers and unfriendlies in dimensional structures as well.
        Copy



Oh one more little bitty detail before I forget the amalgamation of 66 ancient documents that we call the Holy Bible is redundant to express one single message over and over and over and over again that the scope of what's going on here is larger than the planets or the stars or the molecular fabric of the skin or even the quantum particles that make up the matrix of the whole place.
        Copy



That what the creator of the heavens and the earth is interested in has nothing to do with the software, the hardware, the biological bag of parts that we call a human body or the roller coaster ride of minutes that we define as a human life but the scope, the precious treasure, the gem amongst the darkness that he is seeking out and looking for.
        Copy



He's interested in the real deal, the point that's calling all the shots for the whole puppet show, the precision parts he's interested in—the real you. But according to those ancient pages it doesn't matter whether you feel like you got served up one coin at the start of this life or 10 where you came from or what place on planet Earth you may have been born. In truth,
        Copy



The particles that make up the human construct are no different than those that make up bunny rabbits, turtles, or even ground beneath your feet. The scope of differences in human conscious condition are larger than light-year separators between intellectual capacities between us and any other living breathing creatures on Earth.
        Copy



According to those pages we are born above things that even these primitive eyes that see like cameras are blind to. What I'm saying is this: appearances can be deceiving. The world you see with your eyes—this place—is couched in a much larger spiritual dimensional reality—the masquerade of particles pretending to be an illusionary material world.
        Copy



You know it is true whether it be a king or a father, you generally see what someone would do with little before you give them much but greater still according to those pages—the real you behind machine infancy stage—you were born to be heir to an empire—the beautiful test—that's precisely what those pages are saying—just thought I'd mention it but before we start looking at a larger scope or smaller scope in this test of evolution we're gonna have to kick Mendel's laws of genetics out of queue—they conflict with evolution.
        Copy



Now Mendel was a contemporary of Charles Darwin; both men lived and worked roughly in same time period. Mendel's laws of genetics would go on to be well practical day-to-day observable sciences used even this very hour you're watching this video. They're dependent on sciences because they're observable. We can watch them day after day.
        Copy



Whereas Charles Darwin's theory of evolution would go on to violate lengthy lists of other sciences, for example: In Darwin's day it was believed life could spontaneously generate by many folks; for example if mold were to appear perhaps it had spontaneously generated—of course we now know spontaneous generation does not occur.
        Copy



Dr. A. Fleischman zoologist at Erlangen University stated: "The Theory of Evolution suffers from gravest defects which are more apparent as time advances; it can no longer square with practical scientific knowledge." Dr. David A. Kaufman University Florida Gainesville stated: "Evolution lacks scientifically acceptable explanation for precise coding within cells without which there can be no proteins hence no life."

Species, things evolve into other things. So see the dog, he jumped in the water and he is deciding he's going to sort of grow these fin-like things. See, so the dog ultimately turned into a whale. See how the theory works? Mind you, in 1859, when this was proposed by Darwin, it was believed at that time that a single cell was as complex as a ping-pong ball. And God created great whales and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kinds.
        Copy



So here's one of the proposed charts, or ascent transition lines, for evolution. And you can see the drawing here is indicating that the fish is growing arms, which are gonna form a different head and become a tail. And now it's getting fingers down here. The problems with this are intrinsic, beginning with, of course, the digital programming code of DNA is just like software coding for a program. If a program picks up any junk code, error code, or mutation code into any of the lines of its complete coding, it will by no means make a better program. Even a single human finger is beyond imagination in precision programming scope. But the problems are larger than even the genetics.
        Copy



For practical example, you may have heard it said that dinosaurs became birds. A bird's wings make the neck on the giraffe look like absolute child's play. You are talking about going from a functional leg on an animal into an apparatus, a functional apparatus that flies. If you took every piece of sophisticated military hardware for aviation that we have ever devised, collaborated them into one single entity or organism, you would be nowhere close to the sophistication of the systems on one single species of bird.
        Copy



Our best technology, some of it extremely impressive, but also in terms of practical reality, primitive, sort of clunky, as well as resource-consuming, inefficient, and often very catastrophic by comparison to this creature right here, majesty of just one of these biological masterpieces. The birds sort of make the whole flying thing look easy, don't they? Not to mention the fact that if you've got a leg becoming a wing, it's going to be a bad leg long before it makes a good wing.
        Copy



If an animal was mutating in any way, that's going to injure its chances for survival. Not one change of species into another is on record. We cannot prove that a single species has ever changed. That quote is from none other than Charles Darwin himself. Now each program on this screen has exactly the coding inside of it that it needs at the very start. Otherwise the program would not exist.
        Copy



So if I've got a monkey that is slowly turning into a person, there has to be actual cellular coding for every little tiny piece of the transition. Just like these computer programs on this screen will only open to become what they are because their lines of software coding only have the specific line-for-line instructions to open and become whatever the program is. You need precise code for every single line because just like computer software, this coding has no extra instructions for making spare parts.
        Copy



It has exactly inside those digital instructions the coding that it precisely needs to make the organism exactly as it is, with no spare coding. What do you imagine might occur if I took one of these programs on this screen and began adding random lines of mutant junk code to one of these programs on this screen? Would it increase and make the program evolve to become a better program?
        Copy



Or option B, do you think that adding random code, junk code and mutation code, to precision genetic software might not ever get a dog to change body plans and all of its genetic coding and become a whale? So what do you think? If we were to add junk code to one of these pieces of software or programs, does the program fall apart? Or does it become a better program?
        Copy



And whatever the case, evolution is stating that random accidents in the precision genetic coding began to accidentally spit out every direction and every kind of creature and species on planet Earth. Despite entropy, biogenesis and all of Mendel's laws of genetics, and also ignoring all of these basic day-to-day observable sciences, one would anticipate that the evidence for all of these transitions, which would have to occur, spitting out mutant animals and creatures in every conceivable direction should be readily available and easy to find within the fossil record.
        Copy



Strangely though, the evidence on the entire face of the whole planet Earth for all of this science-defying activity seems to be primarily confined to this single set of monkey bones. Jeffrey Schwartz, in his book "Sudden Origin," stated, and I quote, "Given that evolution, according to Darwin, was in a continual state of motion, it follows logically that the fossil record should be rife with examples of transitional fossils leading from less to more evolved."
        Copy



Yet instead of filling in the gaps in the fossil record with so-called missing links, most paleontologists have found themselves in a situation where there are only gaps in the fossil record with no evidence of transformational intermediate between documented fossil species. So despite just what Charles Darwin said in his own day—that there is no evidence of species changing from one to another—and the fossil record working to further illustrate that animals stay within their spectrums not seeming to have fossils that change into one another.
        Copy



Ben Eldredge stated in his book "The Myths of Human Evolution," and I quote, "The fossil record flatly fails to substantiate the expectation of finely graded changes over time." Despite all of that—the fossil record and all of the sciences—let's go a tad bit deeper. Because one would think if you were going to search for evolution surely you would find it in the simplest of insects.
        Copy



Now it is true that since the early 1900s—almost a hundred years now—we've been doing fruit fly experiments. Tens of thousands probably millions of generations of fruit flies at this point have been bred in labs and they do all sorts of weird stuff to them to try and encourage mutations. They're trying to get them to have a mutation that has a genetic benefit as well as pass it on. Basically they're trying to prove evolution. At this point with tens of thousands of these that have occurred, the statement that arises from the fruit fly experiments is that they appear to be immune to evolution.
        Copy



And they use the fruit flies because they have short lifespans—about 11 days. On top of that, the flies are really inexpensive—they're cheap. In fact, was it not Morris Corry who said out of our 400 mutations there's not one that can be called a new species? Or Norman Macbeth who quoted if 1,000 mutations were combined all into one specimen we still would not have a new species.
        Copy



So this guy here is a motor protein headed towards the nucleus of the cell on these little bitty highways. Or perhaps you may prefer Francis Hitching—hardcore atheist mind you—who stated and I quote "Fruit flies refuse to become anything other than fruit flies under any circumstances yet devised." He's battery charged by the mitochondria.
        Copy



Or just for good measure how about Gordon R. Taylor who stated "It's striking that geneticists have been breeding fruit flies for more than 60 years all around the world. Flies which produce a new generation every 11 days yet they have never seen the emergence of even as much as a new enzyme." And these guys here are little bitty turbines which are turning and they're powering billions of little mitochondria batteries.
        Copy



But even if you find deterioration in the insects and you can't find evolution in them surely at least you could find some kind of improvements happening even in the microscopic world—little bitty cells wouldn't you think? And it's not just the fruit flies that they've been trying this mutation thing on mind you.

Michigan State University evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski and his colleagues have searched for signs of evolution in bacteria—single-celled bacteria now for more than 20 years tracking more than 40,000 generations. And in the end right now up until today every part of the cell is doing a job that functions some other part have been at bare minimum just lateral most in sheer volume degenerative.

A fact which caused University of Bristol bacteriology professor Alan Linton to state "Where's the experimental evidence? None exists in the entire history of mankind more importantly the history of science itself on entire earth." There's not one experimental example to date of a cell mutating one single upward notch of function or new improvement And it's not for lack of trying interestingly enough.

Are not just comprised of little bitty cellular factories that are more sophisticated than every single automated factory on earth combined into a space so small that you can barely see it with our largest microscopes and then run with digital precision software. But the inside of those cells are made of little bitty machines all doing things so that you and I can even exist at all. Was Dr. Doug Axe and Dr. Ann Goger that came up with these numbers here. Assuming you started with your complete cell, your complete earth, and you've got your digital software running inside the cell, now you need coordinated mutations, coordinated accidents to occur within these strands on the DNA. So to get six coordinated mutations to produce one new beneficial function on the inside of a single cell would take 16 billion years. Sixteen billion years is the currently believed age of the entire universe. I didn't like their numbers so I kicked it way up. Why not? The one trillion coordinated mutations, that would be almost enough for one earthworm. Give or take. On this planet, which shouldn’t mathematically be here. If we were to speed him up, he's actually walking a lot faster than that. I don't know. Just doesn't look random to me.

You know I'm thinking that the answers could very easily be a little bit larger in scope. Maybe the history of the place might could bring some illumination. This is Dr. Jack Horner. Now Jack was a technical advisor on the 1991 movie Jurassic Park. He was doing an archeological dig when they found... The scientific world is still reeling from the discovery of actual Tyrannosaurus Rex cells and soft tissue unearthed last week at a Montana excavation site.
        Copy



Now since that first discovery of actual soft tissue inside T-Rex bones, I've heard many many commentators suggest that to get the date of extremely alive looking soft tissue like this actual image of T-Rex soft tissue on the screen right here, you don't want to actually test the meaty looking dinosaur tissue itself. That would be a big no-no. What you want to do apparently is test the rocks which are around the soft tissue.
        Copy



You don't want to test the soft tissue. You want to test the rocks which are around the soft tissue. Well I mean, the elephant in the room is that when you're dealing with tissue that looks that fresh with blood vessels, then your animal is probably not 65 million years old. Here's how long living tissue lasts, and somewhere three or four football fields that way is 65 million years.
        Copy



You know Mary, when I was reading about this story, I was amazed that in some of the capillaries when you went to pull them, they snapped right back. Are you amazed at the quality of these remains? Absolutely. 70 million years old, huh? It's just doesn’t seem possible, but yes you can actually take the vessels and they do have internal components and so you can take a probe and kind of squeeze those things out into solution and the vessels are fine. It's just I can't explain it to be honest. Very cool.
        Copy



I have a lot of respect for Jack Horner. Let me put this in perspective for you. This man here on the screen released a discovery that he made which disagrees with many of his own conjectures about dinosaurs. You got to admit though Jack, despite all of the agendas or voices that may be out there concerning fossils, it's almost like somebody placed the bigger thing right in the palm of your hand.
        Copy



But in truth, it's not just the old T-Rex. The soft tissue is being discovered inside of, for example, this 70 million year old Mosasaur tissue found or perhaps this claimed 80 million year old Hadrosaur on the screen right here. Look at how gooey and fresh that tissue looks right there on the screen. The list of these could keep on going and the truth is I'm not terribly surprised.

The word dinosaur or dinosauria, meaning terrible lizard, did not exist until 1841. Prior to that the name was dragon, meaning the big lizard that you definitely did not want to run across. It's not just that there are redundancies of drawings of these things all over the face of the planet Earth, but there are thousands of writings about these creatures and sculptures found everywhere from the smallest little bitty tribes to the largest empires.
        Copy



In truth, who could actually count how many dragon stories that there are on the face of the planet Earth accompanied with drawings of the creatures? In fact, the old science book Historia Animalium claims that in the 1500's dragons, dinosaurs, were extremely rare but were still existent at that time. You couldn't make this stuff up.
        Copy



Alexander the Great wrote about dinosaur dragons in India. Herodotus, the Greek historian from the 4th century BC, often called the father of history itself, not only wrote about dragons but did a fantastic job giving descriptions of these creatures and gave a step-by-step walkthrough of how the Egyptians would smoke out the pterodactyls from the trees. Aristotle, Greek philosopher from the 3rd century BC, also gave eyewitness accounts to these large reptile creatures, dragons, as well as descriptions of the flying lizards similar to the thunderbird or pterodactyl head found at the top of Indian prayer sticks.
        Copy



Marco Polo, the explorer from the 12th to 13th century AD, gave incredible accounts about large dragon beasts in the chronicles and records of his journeys. And we can be pretty certain that they weren't telling these dinosaur dragon stories as myths because we've got the bones for them. Complete with the gooey, fresh and soft dragon tissue.

I could pretty easily be persuaded to believe that the person that drew all of these lines on this icca stone right here knew what a triceratops looked like.

I think it would also be extremely difficult to convince the Asian cultures that there weren't dragons. In truth, you could spend hours going through all of the inscriptions found all across the ancient world. And the amazing thing is how remarkably similar many of the reliefs are to actual bone structures that we find fossilized underneath the earth.

Look at this enormous Chinese lizard grabbing hold of that deer right there. In fact, the Chinese zodiac has eleven regular day-to-day animals on it as well as one dragon.

So if I've got a real big animal that's on top of the ground and it dies, how does it get buried underneath the earth? If an animal dies on the surface of the ground, whether it be a giraffe, I mean it can't sink down there. I mean this is a real big animal. Or a bronchiosaurus on top of the ground, solar dust can't fall on it. How does something this size get down there?
        Copy



These enormous animals are commonly found in mass underground dinosaur graveyards, literal mass burials, as if the creatures were herding and whatever happened, happened all at once fast and unexpected. If it dies on the surface, it's just going to decompose and other things are going to come along and eat it. It's definitely not going to sink down under the earth, become compressed and turn into a fossil on its own.

Now it is true that liquefaction would do that, I mean it would throw all sorts of stuff underneath the ground, including your fossilized fish, your dinosaurs and all of these big animals. It would even divvy up your strata if you had water that was pumping around and loosening up the sediments of the ground and then you'd get your layers.
        Copy



But for that to happen, you would need an awful lot of water and these guys here would settle into those different strata, pumping around on the surface of the ground. This increasing pressure in the subterranean water steadily stretched the crust as a balloon stretches when the pressure inside increases. Failure in the crust began as a microscopic crack that grew in both directions at almost three miles per second.
        Copy



The crack, following the path of least resistance, encircled the globe in about two hours. As the crack raced around the earth, the overlying rock crust opened up like a rip in a tightly stretched cloth. So much water exploded violently out of the rupture.

The 12 stone tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh are among my favorite reads because they document some of these findings beautifully: The oldest written epic in our world even documents these phenomena well! Actual records from Kings like Uruk show us historic insight about ancient settlements and accounts mentioning such floods.
        Copy



The intriguing part mentions quick freezing events—like what might indeed have happened during extreme conditions in prehistoric times when enormous amounts of water were discharged suddenly from under Earth's crust! Frozen mammoths indeed echo such events—frozen solid amidst temperate zones!

Sumerian Kings' List also helps align chronologically this global deluge! Sediments trapped while rushing waters solidified plants & fauna alike into our rich fossil testimonies today: Consider plates still pivoting over latent forces beneath them long past initials slowing before instantaneously piling uplifts like Mount Ranges cresting ocean-spanning fissures!

I find it fascinating hearing every ancient narrative hinting recurring motifs around global cataclysms hidden among remaining relics: Intersecting high-pressure fountains dispersing life & debris echoing scores storied cataclysms written through millennia—from Gilgamesh' epochs' stone tablets narrating catastrophic durations defining further millennia after mankind's rebirth!

Over the entire winter and reanimate, literally come back to life. So the craft itself is 75 feet wide, would be 450 feet in length, all the way to the end of that boat down there, and it would be 45 feet, three stories tall. At its smallest possible measurements, that's longer than a football field by a lot. Now insects will definitely fit on the boat, and there's no argument about that part of it, but when it comes to insects, they'll pretty much make it through anything, or the larva, or hitch a ride on all of the floating stuff. Cockroaches will survive anything.

Just like in Mendel's laws of genetics, how many genetic lines of parent creatures do I need to create the spectrums and arrays of animal species that we see on this planet? So this is roughly your layout. You've got 98% sea life, amphibians, insects, bacteria, and actually those numbers would probably be larger than that if you tossed in all of your different funguses and plant life as well, in comparison to the qualifying animals that you would need on that vessel, which would be your land mammals, reptiles, and birds.

The Russian silver fox experiments going on now for more than 50 years are one of the more beautiful examples of animals, in this case, foxes, producing, limited to their genetic kinds, the array of variables and appearances within animal types. Look at this first silver fox here. Now look at this silver fox, as well as these cute little silver fox variations produced within the 50-year ongoing Russian silver fox experiments. This is commonly termed as microevolution, meaning that the species can work with preexisting code within their animal kinds, which is grandly different than Darwinian evolution where things are becoming other creatures and transforming. These animals are restricted within their animal kinds. Bottom line, this fox can have other variations of foxes, but its genetic coding does not contain the information to turn into a whale.
        Copy



Actually, genetically speaking, everything on this planet is losing genetic information. This is particularly observable in viruses, but in all the creatures on the planet, we're actually degrading, just like with entropy, and losing species counts. The current numbers on extinction rate are anywhere between 1,000 species a year to 10,000 between all of these types of creatures, and depending on whose numbers that you listen to, but we're certainly losing things and not gaining them. And the same applies to our genetic coding.
        Copy



So, in theory, if you rewound time, the genetic coding in the past, further up this line, would be stronger. Whatever the case, it was John Woodmarappy that came up with these numbers here. She would need 8,000 genera—actual couples or 8,000 family kinds—to produce the spectrums of creatures that we see on this planet right now today. That number makes provision for the extinction rate as well as, interestingly enough, he packed in all of the dinosaurs into that figure.
        Copy



By the way, so I went with the smallest measurements of the interior of the boat for Noah's Ark, but now we're gonna take that a step further. Scratch out those numbers of 8,000 times them by almost four, kick it up to 30,000 kinds crammed into the boat. That vessel on the screen right there could hold the equivalent of 522 full-size railroad boxcars. In layman's terms, that would be 125,000 full-size sheep. Most of these animal kinds, which again I bumped the number way up on, are nowhere close to the size of a full-sized sheep. It's a lot of boat. How many times does 30,000 go into 125,000? And 30,000 is four times what it's believed you would actually need.
        Copy



If you were to go with the largest measurements of a cubit, this number would be almost double that. And this would be more than two football fields. From a sheerly mathematical perspective, at the smallest measurements, this boat will do the job. That's probably, bar none, the most stable design of a vessel that you could have. If that ship were to go almost vertical in any direction, it would still float. It's nearly impossible for that boat to flip.
        Copy



Proportionately speaking, it might not have gotten every animal herded onto the boat. Anything not inside when those doors closed might not be around anymore. You ever notice that sometimes animals just know that the storm is coming? And more than that, where the safety is? How do you imagine they do that?

Now we know what our ages of ancient empires were, right? We've got the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans and then some would argue we're in Rome phase two. And these cultures going all the way back to the beginning were building architecture that engineers marvel at. How can this possibly be done? Even with equipment that we have today.
        Copy



The dynasties of ancient Egypt started at 2800 to 3000 BC where you see your first little beginnings of the empire of Egypt at dynasty zero. In this Egyptian king's list you see Seti and the young Ramses the Great was important to these ancient cultures to keep meticulous track of who was in charge and why. But looking back in ancient Egyptian prehistory they also had a flood story in which the Egyptians believed that they were descendants from the man who survived the global flood on a boat that had saved all mankind.
        Copy



It is at that 3000 BC mark that we begin to see the ancient world come to life in this area right in here. Little settlements beginning to take shape. The fertile crescent Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates and over here alongside the Nile Riverbank—the first trickles—the tiny inceptions of our known history start in that spance of land right there. That's what they mean when you hear them say it goes dark after 3000 BC.
        Copy



Anything after that date is a big question mark. 3000 BC is not just when you see your first settlements beginning to take shape and rise into empires; that's also the area where the boat that saved all mankind is said to have landed—the legend of Yu. After the great worldwide flood a man named Yu surveyed the land of China.
        Copy



In the Far East, the Xia Dynasty—the first dynasty of ancient China—started its inception at 2000 BC. Many snakes and dragons were driven off from the marshlands. The peoples and lands of ancient India were divided up until conquered by Alexander the Great between the years of 327 to 325 BC.
        Copy



And then at the point of Alexander's death in 323 BC you see the rise of the first empire of India—the Murian Dynasty.
        Copy



That brings us back to our first empire—Egypt—the place where the first pyramids would begin to rise at about 2600 BC—and our oldest written king story—the 12 Tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh—King of Uruk called by some—the oldest city in the world. Gilgamesh is listed in the Sumerian Kings List as one of the first kings following the flood living somewhere between 2700 and 2900 BC.
        Copy



From the land of Sumer in ancient Mesopotamia Gilgamesh took 50 men to cut down cedar trees and they were confronted by an ancient dinosaur dragon that they had to conquer. But it's after that that story of Gilgamesh really begins. Gilgamesh would ultimately go on a journey to find one of sons of man who had built boat saved all mankind.
        Copy



Many historians believe it was Ham that Gilgamesh referenced in his 12 Tablets; however it's important note use term son of ancient world as is used Epic Gilgamesh can also mean grandson great-grandson or even great-great-great-great-great-grandson.
        Copy



But whatever case if Gilgamesh meets one sons Noah about right here then means flood can't be too far direction.

Commentators speculate conjecture flood occurred at 10,000 BC my question would be this: How come from this point here I can find cultures rising up into least six different empires right in here but on this side from here all way back 3,000 to 10,000 BC—that is 7,000 years—and then all sudden out blue from same range mountains boat said landed fertile crescent Mesopotamia right over here Nile River Egypt little settlements pop up at 3,000 BC flat line.

So was Noah's flood at 3,000 BC? It wasn't there you tell me. But I know this: it's incredibly difficult for me believe seashells like this one here or perhaps these slowly crept their way up top highest mountain world Everest Himalayas or worse still.
        Copy





That there were guys on those mountain peaks tossing out seashells just for kicks. In reality, there are strange things, seashells, marine life, and fish fossils found in mountain ranges all across the amazement of the whole earth. Speaking of fish that are out of place, 75 different kinds of full-sized whales were found fossilized in a mass graveyard of whale fossils in the Atacama Desert, the most arid desert in the world, in Chile. How do you imagine 75 whales that size might end up in the middle of a desert? Perhaps they just forgot that they weren't dogs anymore, sort of crawled out there. No matter how you cut it, our history has got a lot of curveballs in it.

And at the center of our history, the very point right between BC, before Christ, and AD after dead, Jesus Christ, a physical body born of no social class who would be covered more than any king that has lived or breathed or walked on the empires of this earth. There are at least 365 extremely specific prophecies about the coming of that child, given from more than 20 different prophets, including Elisha, Elijah, and Daniel in ancient Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel, living in 600 BC, predicted the rise and fall, rise and fall of empires that would come after his time with 100% accuracy, including the birth and early death of Alexander the Great and the splitting of the whole empire into the lands of the four generals under Alexander after his death.
        Copy



It's not just Zechariah that predicted the Messiah would enter Jerusalem on the back of a donkey, Daniel predicted the exact day and date, nearly 600 years before Jesus rode that donkey through that front gate. Isaiah, who wrote the pages and prophecies seen on this recreation of a Dead Sea Scroll, lived in the 8th century BC, not only predicted the fall of the most powerful city in the world, Babylon, but predicted exactly how the city would fall and the name of the man who would do it, Cyrus. Then when Babylon fell, it was actually Daniel who walked out and handed King Cyrus a copy of Isaiah's scrolls, written roughly 200 years beforehand, and went through and showed Cyrus his name in that scroll, and exactly how the city was conquered, written by Isaiah roughly 200 years earlier, in fact detailing that the city would be taken by lowering the water and coming in.
        Copy



If you were King Cyrus, it would give you a little bit of a shiver, wouldn't it? Isaiah would go on to prophesy in Isaiah 7.14 that the Messiah would be born of a virgin, Isaiah 9.6-7 that there would be a son called God, Isaiah 49.6 God's salvation would reach the ends of the earth, 35.4-6 the Messiah would perform many miracles, 41-5 he would be preceded by another prophet who would be a messenger, it would be John the Baptist, 53.1-3 he would be rejected, the Pharisees would not be happy campers about this, 53.4-6 he would die for the souls of all mankind, 53.12 he would be numbered amongst the transgressors, 53.9 that he would be buried in a rich man's tomb. This is the actual empty garden tomb where it's believed that Jesus was buried and then resurrected.
        Copy



How do you imagine these men could possibly know these things in advance? But it's not just Isaiah from the 8th century BC or Micah who said verbatim that he would be born in Bethlehem, or Zechariah who prophesied to the penny how much Jesus would be sold out for 500 years in advance, that the Savior would be betrayed for exactly 30 shekels of silver. If I'm allowed to go outside Biblical sources, then that number of 365 precise prophecies about Jesus Christ skyrockets. I can even go pre-flood on prophecies of Jesus Christ. Book of Enoch, the great grandfather of Noah, redundantly prophesied the coming of the Son of Man, the Lord of the Sheep, the one for whom salvation would come not only for the righteous before his coming but all those afterwards, that through his name they shall be saved.
        Copy



And curiously enough, if I take the actual names in order from Adam all the way down to Noah and then I look at the root meaning of those names in Genesis in order, this is what it reads: Man appointed mortal sorrow; the blessed God shall come down teaching. His death shall bring the despairing rest and comfort. Thousands would come to hear Jesus speak. And he's not recorded as being out there selling tickets. Not just healing some who came but healing all who came. On many occasions, the masses wanted to make him king but that's not what he's recorded as having come to do.
        Copy



In many ancient cultures of the world, kings would sacrifice their subjects to underworld gods; spare no expense to feed darkness other people's lives. Jesus Christ would be the complete reverse of this. Remember I mentioned the underworld gods? What greater love could one have than to lay down their life for their friends? The eyes of the blind opened. This is exactly what made men like the Pharisees behind the scenes unhappy. Under the cover of night in the garden of Gethsemane when the high priest and his soldier minions came in to get Jesus and Peter jumped up with other disciples and cut off the high priest's ear. Jesus stops him and says," The cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
        Copy



Then fascinatingly, the last miracle recorded by Jesus before that cross is to put back on the ear of his own enemy. This is the box holding the body of the high priest that demanded that Jesus be crucified. So I guess nobody's really confused about where he's at today. And here's the tomb where Jesus was for three days. I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forevermore and have the keys to death, hell, and the grave.
        Copy



After being resurrected, Jesus got together with the disciples and with people for forty days. From Mount Olives in Jerusalem, Jesus ascended with a cast of heaven's hosts. That's why he's covered much more than any king; even Alexander the Great who conquered 90% of the known world before his death. Nothing recorded is going on as usual. After the ascension of Jesus as word began to spread further and further; Pharisees came out with fierce rage.
        Copy



Ten out of twelve disciples were ultimately systematically hunted out; tortured and crucified in horrible torturous ways. Pharisees told Peter -the very one who had stepped out from boat and walked on water- for merely a moment; if denied Jesus they’ll let him live!

It was in 1917 that Albert Einstein discovered the cosmological constant that he himself thought the numbers couldn't be right. But as we know today it turns out he was right. Well I mean he's Einstein. In layman's terms the finite construct of this thing that we call a universe and all of its majestic mechanical clockwork are fine-tuned to one part in a trillion trillion trillion.
        Copy



What I'm telling you is this. The finite precision construct of the entire universe, trillion trillion inside which is the earth, which most definitely should not be here. Trillion trillion with the precision beings constructed of digital software, that would be you and I with no spare mutating parts, that are consciously self-aware comprised of cells that are more sophisticated than every factory on the face of the earth run by biological software.
        Copy



The cosmological constant, the fine-tuning precision of every piece of the universe is set to one part in one with a hundred and twenty zeros behind it. On the other hand this cosmological constant is tuned to one part and ten to the 120, a hundred and twenty decimal places. Nobody thinks that's accidental. In fact it's the cosmological constant that caused some physicists to come up with what they call multi-universe theory, sometimes also called Elvis theory, meaning that if you had an infinite number of universes, perhaps in one of those universes you could have one where every single particle struck right every single time.
        Copy



Trillion, you've got to really want for there to be no creator. Pretty bad for the multi-universe theory. Trillion and one part in that entire monster of a number. Yeah, it doesn't look random. No matter how you cut it, you're in a finite construct. That in and of itself is powerful knowledge.

Let's take a look at the particles of that construct. Within the area of just physics alone there is probably nothing that will more quickly shove you into the metaphysical, the spiritual, and the dimensional than talking about that subatomic matrix of reality. This is not a trite issue. That is the framework, the actual particles upon which all of this sits. The paradox in every single piece of this place. Everything.
        Copy



It's not just that time and space dissolve into paradox. That's the wrong way to look at it. It's from paradox that time and space actually become. So this is the nucleus of my atom with a cloud of superposition of possibilities all poking up all around it. An ocean of little intelligent dots. The three-dimensional pixels of this place. A program writing in the material world. Reality on its finest scale can appear like a majesty of little waves, vibrations of notes. But that can be deceptive because if one were to dive a little bit deeper, it's actually made of little bitty dots.
        Copy



In layman's terms, it's digital. It is not analog. Everything here in this place is actually quantitized. The very frame fabric of the entire place. That's the term quantum mechanics. It's all in little bitty digital dots appearing out of seemingly thin space. Doing it so fast that it creates the illusion of something solid like this microphone here.
        Copy

Was Max Planck the actual father of quantum physics who discovered Planck time? That time moves at 10 to the negative 43 seconds? This is not just the particle vibrating up and down or oscillating back and forth. This is literally the particle actually being the notes. This is what they mean when they say that the particle has no locality. That time and space dissolve at that point. It's literally appearing where it needs to be next.
        Copy



Matter is 10 to the negative 33 centimeters. Give or take. Beginning as children one of the first things that we learn is that time from our perception operates in a linear fashion. It only goes one way.
        Copy



You know one could almost think that time and the particle pixels of reality itself were actually connected. Imagine that you're watching a parade and here come the drummers and the other instrumentalists and you're watching it one frame at a time from the ground.
        Copy



Just like the particles of this place that seem to be appearing and generated as we go along, so also is time. Correct? So time is passing. One drummer person, one person stepping by at a time.
        Copy



So this is the beginning of an event and this is the ending of an event. In fact, this could represent someone's entire lifetime.
        Copy



And imagine that you came up from above the parade outside the construct of the entire universe. So you were outside time in a helicopter above the parade. And you could see the starting area or the staging area.

Watch the parade come around the buildings and actually see where it ends all simultaneously. But you and I are not outside of the construct. In fact, we're dead inside of it.

Nightmare, horror show of putting together that particular construct. You need a new universe. If you're intellectually honest, you need a new universe. Under the multi-universe theory, every time a particle flips, this means you need infinities of infinities of infinities of infinities of headaches, more infinities of universes and writing it all out on paper.
        Copy



And finally, number three last one that I'll give on that: even if you went through all of the mental acrobatics, they're required to come up with the multi-universe theory, it still doesn't make time, space, or matter. But I still really, really like it because it's got Elvis. How could I not like it? Good work, guys. Let's take a look at another one.
        Copy



Only conscious beings can be observers. Then we're intimately hooked in to the very existence of reality. Without us, there would just be this expanding superposition of possibilities with nothing definite ever actually happening. If you want to see fear in a quantum physicist's eyes, just mention the words "the measurement problem." The measurement problem is this: an atom only appears in a particular place if you measure it. In other words, an atom is spread out all over the place until a conscious observer decides to look at it. So the act of measurement or observation creates the entire universe.
        Copy



I like this one, I really do a lot for a number of reasons, but I might suggest this: if consciousness does not create the particle, or the material world, the consciousness is a prerequisite for doing the measurement at all. They're two entirely separate issues: the consciousness and the particle you're actually looking at. The very fabric, the place where reality becomes when you're doing your measurement, you're looking at the first point where the particle is available for measurement.
        Copy



So if I'm understanding some of our current conjectures properly: in the beginning, there was nothing; nothing exploded and became sheer precision everything. The rocks began spitting out digital coding, the dogs became whales, the monkeys turned into people, and as the final touch it's actually Elvis on the other side of reality. I find myself strangely hesitant to commit to all that.

Perhaps finding myself in more agreement with Max Planck, the actual founder of quantum mechanics itself who said—and I quote—"All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of the atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume that behind this force, the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter." That was Max Planck, the actual father of quantum physics itself.

Now in the ancient world, they were talking about dimensions but they were not drawing Elvis. In fact, they were drawing strange things in the skies as well as biological creatures—anomalies that puzzle us—things that they said could step right out of thin air. Which is interesting because they were building architecture to their gods that baffles us even to this very day.

I'm not finding on their walls where they're talking about their gods coming from other planets. They are redundantly talking about strange physical and spiritual beings as well as strange things that seem to occupy the skies—some of it able to pull tricks that seem to defy even the laws of physics. And deeper still things claim to step through momentarily, not dissimilar to claims even right now today: disturbing claims within the arenas of psychology, claimed alien abductions, things said to literally pop up not from space but right inside people's bedrooms.

Shadow people, body paralysis, serpent snake reptilian creatures—not dissimilar to the wisdom serpents throughout not just Egypt but the entirety of the ancient world: Anunnaki, the biblical sons of Anak or also called the Nephilim both before and after the flood as is recorded by the Sumerian texts. You know when I think about it there are a lot of things in the ancient world that have this sort of reptile cold-blooded twist—serpent sort of a strange animal for a king to get his wisdom from don't you think?

And if one were to go from the lights that appear in the sky down through the fringe level stuff and then delve into the furthest regions of the occult, the accounts only become more discomforting. They believe that the tentacles of things might be as close as the air between your fingers as you reach out into empty space. And they built the largest temples on earth to things they believe dwelled in a dark realm.

In fact, I would venture to guess that there are those right on the other side of this camera who have had experiences both light and dark that they might not share with everyone. But when thinking about just things that seem to appear in the sky—boy that's a lot of little dots out there isn't it? And if the same type of activity is recorded from the very earliest parts of time all the way to present day, one might almost think that the phenomenon was—I don't know—localized?

Well if they were coming from other planets you would think we would sense the traffic. And on top of that if you've got something that just steps right out into reality or just appears in the skies—the question really does become: where is it when you don't see it? In fact they were quite specific about where their gods came from— not just in Egypt not just in Babylon cultures all across this globe believe that their gods were in the underworld hell shield Hades Tardis—the world of serpents.

In fact, the beginning of many a king's reign began with the invocation ceremony—the actual calling in from the underworld that the Pharaoh would invite the embodiment of the spirit of an underworld God to consciously rule from below through the mind and body of the Pharaoh himself on the empires above. And it's not just the ancient world: John Dee, the head intelligence officer under Queen Elizabeth I did intense occult rituals and ceremonies with the full funding and backing of the Empire literally cataloging entire hierarchies of entities—some of which looked exactly like what we may define today as an alien.

The official statement of the Empire was that Dee was gaining wisdom from angels; course after John Dee's death his diary told a different story repeatedly saying "I believe they're lying to me these things are not angels they're demons." That was John Dee.

I'm quoting an occultist from present-day who stated—and I quote—"If one were to peer into their world by portal of spirit you could easily perceive it as nothing less than a madness of monsters insects crawling over each other for merely a breath be not deceived these things are highly sophisticated acting out their fantasies through the minds of men. It is by this mechanism that an invisible enemy systematically rules all flesh its best weapon being a single fact that most don't even understand that the patient predator behind the mask even exists."

And when you're dealing with the occult this side of the flood all roads seem to lead to the ancient Empire of Babylon rising up at the inception of our earliest empires in Samaria and down here in Egypt where the wisdom serpents would begin whispering in the ears of Kings now when the first name of the God is underworld doesn't that tend to mean that the God is already beneath you things that have already found their way into the recycle bin of reality perhaps

The drainage canal for stuff that tends to bite the hand that feeds was Jesus Christ who said hell was never made for mankind I wouldn't have it any other way than to end this video with the words of John chapter 3 was when Nicodemus—a wealthy Pharisee—came to see Jesus under cover of night so that no one would see.

And he asked how may one gain eternal life and Jesus replied "Are you not teacher of all Israel and yet you do not know these simple things does not wind blow where it wishes and you neither see where it comes or to where it goes yet you know it's there I tell you so also are those who are born of spirit so do not marvel when I say you must be born again."

Now in Greek born again means born from above or more precisely born from "the place where this place comes from." Special thanks to every man and woman of science as well as and more primarily a special thanks and dedication at end end this video "The Theory Of Everything" to Jesus Christ and a special thanks for an event occurred funny in this life how in merely a moment way view everything can change.

Also, I am the author of Thieves, One Dirty TV Pastor and the Man Who Robbed Him. In 1999, I did, embarrassingly enough, commit a safe robbery on a television pastor named Mike Murdoch. I grew up with his son, horribly embarrassing story for me, thrill ride for you. Take a second to check that out. You can find that on GodInANutshell.com or go over to ReadThieves.com, ReadThieves.com. Here's an article about the book. There's an image of me right there that was drawn by D Magazine, one of the largest magazines in Dallas, Texas. Maybe the largest. You can see there, and Mike Murdoch looks sort of angry. There's me running with a safe from Mike Murdoch.

So, if you're curious about that story or what all went down and how that could have possibly occurred, you're in luck. Here's a clip. Thieves by Trey Smith. Amazon, Barnes and Noble, anywhere books are sold. I've been on radio and TV for 20 years. And Trey, first, as far as the book itself, I'll give you an example. My producer, Will Duffy, his wife, Danielle, was in the hospital to give birth. And they had some time, so Will is reading aloud Thieves. And not only his wife becomes addicted to it, but people in neighboring beds, neighboring rooms, all sat in to listen to Thieves being read. It's like Danielle wanted to delay labor because she was so fascinated.

Thieves was me pouring literally my heart out, day after day. These were all written in a jail cell. And guards used to pay me when they were on shift. They would give me extra lunch trays to read them this book. So Thieves was originally paid for with jailhouse lunch trays. And then, after the safe robbery, when I'm on the run from a television pastor in Mexico, it really kicks into high octane. Sometimes I would just stop and say to myself, there's not a lot of really great ways for any of this to end. Crazy as it seems though, it did all end well. I promise. Thank God for that.

I'm pretty certain that you're not going to find anything like this anywhere. I wanted to tack a note on to the end of this video and state to you that that book Thieves from start to finish, no matter how fun it might be to read, does not in any way represent who I am today. And more than that, I've not only asked forgiveness in my own heart, but from a great many parties who are in that book and who are not in that book that I needed to ask for forgiveness from.
        Copy



More than that, I'd like to give a special thank you to ministries, men and women of faith, churches and organizations all across this United States, because they are not represented. The hearts of the people are not represented by the few that are just take, take, take, take, take. I have seen so many, both great and small ministries, who no matter who they are, they would give you the last shirt off.
