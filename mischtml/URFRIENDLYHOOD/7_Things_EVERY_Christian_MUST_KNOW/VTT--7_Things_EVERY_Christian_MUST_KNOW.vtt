00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 The Bible says that there are seven things that every Christian must know.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.520
 If you call yourself a Christian and you don't know these things, it's honestly over for

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.520
 you.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.800
 And I'm not trying to be edgy or anything when I say this, there are so many Christians

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.319
 out here who don't even know the basics of Christianity, but then go around purporting

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:25.840
 themselves to be Bible teachers, going around condemning others to hell and doing all kinds

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.760
 of other wicked stuff when they don't even know what the Bible teaches.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.439
 They don't even know the fundamentals of the faith.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.900
 So whether you're a babe in Christ or you've been a Christian, you're well seasoned many

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.200
 years in, I think that there's something to take away from this video for everyone.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 I mean, even for me, I've been a Christian going on for like four years now and only

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.479
 just, I don't know, maybe like two years ago, I learned about some of these things because

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.680
 these things really aren't taught in any churches, even though every church should be teaching

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 these things.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.080
 So in Hebrews chapter five, verse 12, it says this for when the time came that you

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.220
 ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.440
 of the oracles of God and are become as such that have need of milk and not of strong meat

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.819
 for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:26.080
 The Bible talks about this distinction between the milk of the word and the meat of the word.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.160
 The milk of the word is the basics of Christianity and the meat of the word is the more complex stuff.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.639
 Before we can get to the meat, the complex, deeper things about the word of God, we need

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.800
 to understand the basics, the milk.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.959
 And like it said in Hebrews chapter five, like we just read, there are many Christians

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.839
 in Paul's day and today that are trying to be teachers when they don't even understand

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:55.019
 the basics.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:02:01.500
 As we go into the next chapter, Hebrews chapter six, Paul begins to list out what things are

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.779
 the basic principles of the prophets of God.

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:12.059
 Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:18.860
 laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith towards God, of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.580
 the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.080
 and of eternal judgment.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.979
 Everything Paul just listed there in that list is the basic principles of the doctrine

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:33.979
 of Christ.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:34.979
 He says it himself.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:42.139
 Many Christians, for example, like Mike Winger, Gavin Ortland, Radim Zumer, and others, treat

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.899
 these basic principles as though they're something up for debate.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.179
 They're constantly debating these things.

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.339
 But Paul says if you don't even understand these things, you shouldn't even be a teacher.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.860
 For example, I mean, Mike Winger is constantly wishy-washy on the basics.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.660
 He calls himself a pastor.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.880
 He's putting himself in a teaching position.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.460
 He shouldn't be doing that.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.699
 People who cannot get established on the basics should not be teaching, should not be calling

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.619
 themselves pastors, should not be behind a pulpit.

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:16.660
 And not only this, but most Christians are actually just totally wrong.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.960
 If they have a solid position on these issues, they're just wrong about it.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.720
 So what I want to do in this video is I want to break down all six of these things and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.320
 then there's a secret seventh one that we're saving to the end of the video so that you

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.559
 guys can be fully furnished and ready to do good works.

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.119
 And by the way, that's what the Bible calls us to do.

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:45.320
 The Bible calls us Christians to go out and preach the word of God to all nations, making

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.839
 disciples of all nations and teaching them to obey what Jesus taught.

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:55.059
 This is the great commission he gives to all of us, not just to some of us.

00:03:55.059 --> 00:04:01.440
 And so we should all be striving to have mastery of the word of God so that we can teach others,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.399
 bring others to Christ so that other people can be saved.

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.360
 And that's the whole reason we're still on the earth.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.240
 Jesus would rapture us right now if we were not called to this purpose.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:19.480
 Anyway, so number one, the first thing that you must understand is repentance from dead works.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.959
 Many Christians, whether they're Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, whatever denomination

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:31.839
 they identify as, they all seem to teach that you have to repent of your sins to be saved.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:34.880
 But did you know the Bible never teaches that?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.959
 Not once in the entire King James Bible, Old or New Testament, do we see the phrase repent

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.480
 of your sins or repent from your sins.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.160
 This never appears.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.000
 And I'm sure that many people who are watching this video are going to have a bunch of verses

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.799
 come to their mind, open up the King James Bible, read that verse.

00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:01.200
 And what you're going to see is that that verse does not say repent of your sins.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.320
 There's not a single verse in the Bible that says that because the Bible never teaches

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.959
 repentance of sins for salvation.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:14.000
 Now, yes, obviously, once we're saved, we are called to stop sinning.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.779
 I'm not telling you to keep sinning.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.500
 But what I'm saying is that for salvation, you don't repent of your sins.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.820
 See, most Christians, and back then it was most Jews, right?

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.459
 Have the belief that in order to get to heaven, you have to be a good person, that there's

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.339
 a certain amount of good works that you have to do.

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.140
 For the Jews, it was keeping the law of Moses.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:41.779
 For Catholics, it's getting baptized, taking the Eucharist, getting your death rites, getting

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.859
 married, the sacraments, repenting of your mortal sins.

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:47.899
 And for most Christians, it's keeping the Ten Commandments.

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:51.379
 But the Bible teaches we are not saved by works.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.979
 In Galatians 2.16, it says works cannot justify a man.

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.819
 And in Romans 4.5, it says that we can get to heaven with no good works whatsoever if

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.259
 we simply just believe in Jesus.

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.779
 An essential thing that you must understand in order to be saved, that in order to go

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:15.419
 to heaven, you have to repent of your dead works.

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.699
 Repentance means that you stop doing something, you change your mind about something.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.339
 And we need to change our mind about good works, thinking that good works get us to

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:26.339
 heaven.

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:31.699
 And we need to realize that all of our works are as filthy rags before God, that God thinks

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.379
 they're totally worthless, and that they will not get us to heaven.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.539
 We trust in Jesus Christ alone for our salvation.

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:45.099
 So every time that you see the phrase, repent and believe in the Bible, 99% of the time,

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.099
 it's not talking about turning away from sin.

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:54.299
 It's talking about repenting of your dead works, that you stop thinking works save you,

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:56.539
 and you trust in Jesus Christ alone.

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.739
 The second thing on this list is faith towards God.

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:02.179
 Now obviously, this is pretty basic, right?

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:05.219
 As Christians, we need to understand God is real.

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:10.019
 And so I recommend that all Christians go and they look up the evidence for God.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:14.539
 But this is a little deeper because there's more to understand than just God is real.

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.619
 We also have to understand, right, that Jesus Christ is God.

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:23.499
 If a Christian's denying that Jesus Christ is God, they are unlearned, they are unstable,

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.339
 they should not be teaching, you shouldn't listen to that person.

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:28.379
 The Bible is so clear on this.

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.779
 Go to 1 John 5, 7.

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:31.779
 What does it say?

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:37.219
 It says there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:38.219
 Ghost.

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:39.739
 Who is the Word of God?

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:42.259
 Jesus Christ, made in the flesh, right?

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:45.139
 So we also have to understand that Jesus is God.

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:49.619
 And another thing that we have to understand is that we put our faith in God in order to

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:50.619
 be saved.

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:54.619
 We put our faith in Jesus Christ alone to be saved, not in our works.

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:58.659
 The third thing on our list is the doctrine of baptisms.

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:04.339
 Now something that should immediately stick out to you is that it says baptisms, as in

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:06.299
 multiple baptisms.

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:11.219
 A lot of Christians don't realize this, but there are actually multiple different baptisms

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:13.699
 you can get according to the Bible.

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:17.279
 There's three of them as far as the New Testament is concerned.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:23.899
 The baptism of water, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and baptism of fire.

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:26.899
 But only one baptism saves you.

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:32.099
 Now many Christians, they try to push these three different baptisms together as though

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.419
 they're one baptism.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:37.619
 That when you get baptized in water, you get baptized with the Holy Ghost, and baptism

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:40.179
 of the Holy Ghost is baptism of fire.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.379
 But as John the Baptist says in the Gospels,

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:49.659
 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, repentance of dead works.

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:55.919
 But he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:02.419
 But he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:08.160
 he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.080
 But he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.359
 So right there the Bible teaches there are three different baptisms.

00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:18.540
 Water baptism, Holy Ghost baptism, fire baptism.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.540
 The first and most important one that I want to mention is the Holy Ghost baptism.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.540
 See when we believe in Jesus, the Holy Ghost comes and indwells us.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.419
 It says in Ephesians 1.13,

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:36.260
 In whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:42.580
 in whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.859
 is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:49.619
 the praise of his glory.

00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:54.780
 The Bible teaches right there that when we believe in Jesus, that we are indwelled with

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.980
 the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit seals us until the day of redemption, until

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.739
 the end of the world, and he's the assurance of our salvation.

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:10.419
 Holy Ghost baptism, Holy Spirit baptism is what saves you, and it seals you until the

00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:11.419
 day of redemption.

00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:13.020
 You can't lose your salvation.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.660
 Now after we get baptized with the Holy Ghost, Jesus then commands us to get baptized with

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.660
 water.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:25.100
 The whole point of getting baptized with water is so that we can make a public profession

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.220
 to the world that we are choosing to follow Jesus.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.660
 It's basically like an initiation ritual.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.859
 It's the first step to the Christian life.

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:38.820
 And then the third baptism, the baptism of fire does not happen to believers, but it

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:44.220
 happens to unbelievers when in the day of judgment, people are going to be thrown into

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.220
 hell.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.500
 The next thing on our list is laying on of hands.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.220
 Did you know that the Bible teaches that you can cast out demons?

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.900
 Many people don't believe this, the Catholics teach that only bishops can cast out demons,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.220
 but this is not true.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.980
 The Bible says that any believer, no matter who you are, that you can cast out demons

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.660
 through the authority you have been given in Christ.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.540
 In Mark 16 15, Jesus says,

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.720
 Go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.359
 He that believes and is baptized will be saved, and he that believes not will be damned.

00:11:21.359 --> 00:11:24.080
 And these signs shall follow them that believe.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.600
 In my name they shall cast out devils.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.559
 They shall speak in new tongues.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:33.320
 They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.520
 They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.640
 If anyone is telling you that the gifts are not alive in the body, that Christians today

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.760
 can't perform miracles like casting out demons, they're just wrong.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.159
 The fact is I've personally seen this in my own life.

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:53.700
 I've seen a demonically possessed man obey the authority of Christ.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.279
 I command them to start walking around in circles.

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:58.200
 They get up, they start walking around in circles.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.119
 I command them to lay on the ground, they lay on the ground.

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:05.359
 You command these demons in the name of Jesus, they have to obey you.

00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:12.479
 God has given all Christians power and authority over sicknesses, over poison, over these things.

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:17.659
 Now again, the Bible does not say we will always be able to perform every miracle we

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:22.799
 want to perform, but the fact is that we can do these things through the power of God if

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:24.159
 God wills it.

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:29.039
 But as Jesus teaches, there are some demons that you can't cast out without prayer and

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.039
 fasting.

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:35.919
 But still, the point is that we have power and authority in Christ that we can lay hands

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.799
 on the sick and they will be healed.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:41.080
 The fifth thing on this list is the resurrection of the dead.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.239
 Many Christians, mostly just babes in Christ, they envision the afterlife as being like

00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:50.599
 going up into a cloud and you have a harp and you have some angel wings and a halo and

00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:52.640
 it's like a big church service forever.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.400
 This is not what the Bible teaches.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.739
 The Bible is very clear, good passage is 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, that the dead are

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:04.880
 physically going to come back to life in the last days.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.359
 See, as a Christian, we're not waiting for an afterlife where we're just going to be,

00:13:10.359 --> 00:13:11.359
 you know, ghosts.

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:14.760
 No, we are going to have physical eternal life.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.000
 When Jesus promises eternal life, he's talking about your physical body is going to come

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.119
 back to life in the last days.

00:13:22.119 --> 00:13:27.200
 And another aspect of this resurrection of the dead is that Jesus came back to life after

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200
 he died.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.960
 Three days after he died, he rose from the dead.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.919
 And if a Christian is denying this, they're not saved, at least in my opinion.

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:40.119
 And just like how Jesus came back to life three days after he died, we are going to

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:45.739
 come back to life after we die when Jesus comes back during the second coming.

00:13:45.739 --> 00:13:51.320
 If you want deeper wisdom on this, I have a video about whether hell is eternal and

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.239
 in this, I go really deep into this discussion about the resurrection of the dead, the new

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:59.599
 earth and heaven and what it all looks like, what's it all about.

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:04.200
 And there's actually two different hells in the Bible, but go watch that video if you're

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.200
 interested.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.279
 And our final point, at least in this list that Paul gives us, though I have one more

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:14.320
 seventh point that you need to know, has to do with hell and that's eternal judgment.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.640
 Listen, many Christians don't like this, but the fact is that once you die, your eternal

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.659
 destiny is sealed.

00:14:22.659 --> 00:14:26.400
 Whether you are going to heaven, whether you're going to hell, whether you are partaking in

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.760
 the resurrection of the dead or whether you're going to the lake of fire, our judgments are

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.039
 eternal.

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.580
 They cannot be changed.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.960
 And the Bible's pretty clear that if you are saved, if you've put your faith and trust

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.119
 in Jesus Christ alone for your salvation and you're not trusting your works and you say,

00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:46.359
 Jesus, I believe you are the reason I'm going to heaven.

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:47.559
 It's not about me.

00:14:47.559 --> 00:14:48.559
 It's not my works.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:49.760
 It's not my repentance.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.520
 If you believe that, you are eternally secure and you can never lose your salvation.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.320
 Our judgment, whether it's a good judgment or a bad judgment, is eternal.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.080
 You cannot lose your salvation and the people who are dead who haven't believed in Christ,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.720
 they don't get a second chance.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.520
 You're not going to get a second chance to believe in Jesus.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.280
 Now I'm sure people got to be asking by now, Luis Sanz, what's the seventh secret thing?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.880
 Well, the seventh thing that I think all Christians need to know is what the distinction between

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.920
 the milk and the meat is.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.440
 Listen, we've already described what the milk is.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.760
 These six things that we just talked about, they are the milk.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.799
 These are the basics of Christianity.

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:33.600
 Essentially what this list is, is it's the gospel.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.559
 That God is real, that God is going to judge all people for their sins when they die.

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:40.739
 Good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:46.820
 But if we believe in Jesus and trust in him alone, we can have forgiveness for our sins

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.179
 and we won't go to hell.

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:51.020
 And we have eternal life that we can never lose.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.179
 This is the basics of Christianity.

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:57.220
 All people have to grasp this before they can move on to the meat.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.340
 But the question is, what is the meat?

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.340
 Well, if we head back to Hebrews chapter 5 and go down to the very last verse there,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:11.420
 Strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.720
 their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.100
 The meat of the word, believe it or not, most Christians will try to invert this for you.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.900
 This as above, so below.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.700
 And they try to tell you that the basics of Christianity is repenting of your sins.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700
 You stop sinning.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.340
 You overcome your sin.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.220
 You know, this complicated stuff is like the resurrection, the dead, and heaven, and hell,

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.220
 and all that.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.260
 No, the Bible says the basics is salvation through faith alone and Christ alone.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
 That there's eternal judgment for your sins and all that.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:51.980
 And that the advanced, complex stuff is discerning good from evil, overcoming your sins, repenting

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:57.059
 from your sins, obeying God, obedience to God, walking in the spirit.

00:16:57.059 --> 00:16:59.340
 That's the advanced stuff.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.340
 That's the meat.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.960
 And many Christians, they get confused about this because there's so many false teachers

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.260
 and they want to delve into the meat when they're not ready to chew the meat.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.980
 Just like how a baby, they don't have any teeth, they can't chew anything, they need

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.340
 to drink milk in order to live.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.740
 Babes in Christ, we're a babe in Christ.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:25.720
 We cannot comprehend the deeper things of the word of God that have to do with repentance

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.899
 from sins, overcoming our struggles with addictions, and stuff like that.

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:32.340
 That's advanced stuff for Christians.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.799
 That's not the basics.

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:40.539
 And I see many Christians who are not solid on the basics, not solid on the milk, they

00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:43.299
 delve into deep meat.

00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:49.100
 Books like the book of James, the book of 1 John, the book of Jude, the book of Hebrews.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.179
 They delve into these books, for the most part, are entirely talking about the Christian

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:55.179
 life, right?

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:57.380
 And what is the Christian life like for a Christian?

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.419
 Well, as a Christian, we're supposed to walk in obedience to God, repent from our sins,

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:03.899
 and preach the gospel.

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:09.100
 But because they're not solid on the basics, right, that salvation is by faith alone, in

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.299
 Christ alone, and that it's all about what Jesus did, it's not about our works.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:17.700
 They read these books about the Christian life and they get confused and they end up

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.980
 thinking that salvation is by works when that's not what these books are teaching.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:29.299
 All that James or 1 John or Hebrews is teaching is that as a Christian we should not sin and

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:31.200
 we should do good works.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.659
 But babes in Christ who are not solid on the gospel can't handle being told that they have

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:37.659
 to do good works.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:43.340
 They think that this is some kind of salvational requirement when it's not a salvational requirement.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:49.340
 This is deeper stuff that we're supposed to come to after we establish the basics.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:54.539
 So the seventh thing that all Christians need to know is that we need to interpret

00:18:54.539 --> 00:19:01.260
 these difficult passages like James chapter 2, like 1 John, like Hebrews chapter 10, and

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.640
 Hebrews 6, Hebrews 3, Galatians chapter 5.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:11.019
 We need to interpret these passages which are difficult through the lens of the milk.

00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:16.899
 We need to look at these passages with a full assurance that salvation is by faith alone

00:19:16.899 --> 00:19:25.299
 without works, sola gratia, grace alone, sola fide, faith alone, sola Christus, Christ alone.

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:31.019
 And once you guys fully grasp that then it's time to go to these deeper passages.

00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:35.299
 But when you don't fully grasp the basics you're not going to be able to grasp these

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:36.299
 deeper things.

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:41.460
 And listen, as a Christian you might disagree with me on my understanding of salvation but

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.700
 I have to ask you, what is Hebrews 6 talking about when it says repentance from dead works?

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.140
 What is it talking about when it says that our judgment is eternal?

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:55.059
 What does it mean in Hebrews chapter 5 when it says that the meat is discerning good and evil?

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:59.840
 Regardless, Hebrews 5 and 6 tells us that we need to understand these issues before

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.100
 we can get into discerning good and evil.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.659
 So perhaps you're not convinced salvation is by faith alone.

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:11.240
 But until you understand how salvation works, you can't be lecturing people and trying

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.179
 to teach people about the word of God and you can't be dealing with the complex issues

00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:17.179
 of morality.

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:21.779
 If you want to support the ministry, send a super thanks, it's that little heart with

00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:23.299
 the dollar sign thing.

00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:25.380
 Or just leave a comment, like the video.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.380
 Thanks for watching.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.179
 See you next time.
