0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.480,5.480000019073486, The Bible says that there are seven things that every Christian must know.
1,00:00:05.480,00:00:09.520,4.0400004386901855," If you call yourself a Christian and you don't know these things, it's honestly over for"
2,00:00:09.520,00:00:10.520,1.0, you.
3,00:00:10.520,00:00:13.800,3.2799997329711914," And I'm not trying to be edgy or anything when I say this, there are so many Christians"
4,00:00:13.800,00:00:19.319,5.5199995040893555," out here who don't even know the basics of Christianity, but then go around purporting"
5,00:00:19.319,00:00:25.840,6.520000457763672," themselves to be Bible teachers, going around condemning others to hell and doing all kinds"
6,00:00:25.840,00:00:29.760,3.9200000762939453, of other wicked stuff when they don't even know what the Bible teaches.
7,00:00:29.760,00:00:32.439,2.6799983978271484, They don't even know the fundamentals of the faith.
8,00:00:32.439,00:00:36.900,4.460002899169922," So whether you're a babe in Christ or you've been a Christian, you're well seasoned many"
9,00:00:36.900,00:00:41.200,4.299999237060547," years in, I think that there's something to take away from this video for everyone."
10,00:00:41.200,00:00:46.200,5.0," I mean, even for me, I've been a Christian going on for like four years now and only"
11,00:00:46.200,00:00:50.479,4.279998779296875," just, I don't know, maybe like two years ago, I learned about some of these things because"
12,00:00:50.479,00:00:55.680,5.200000762939453," these things really aren't taught in any churches, even though every church should be teaching"
13,00:00:55.680,00:00:56.680,1.0, these things.
14,00:00:56.680,00:01:01.080,4.400001525878906," So in Hebrews chapter five, verse 12, it says this for when the time came that you"
15,00:01:01.080,00:01:07.220,6.1399993896484375," ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles"
16,00:01:07.220,00:01:13.440,6.220001220703125, of the oracles of God and are become as such that have need of milk and not of strong meat
17,00:01:13.440,00:01:19.819,6.379997253417969, for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe.
18,00:01:19.819,00:01:26.080,6.260002136230469, The Bible talks about this distinction between the milk of the word and the meat of the word.
19,00:01:26.080,00:01:33.160,7.0800018310546875, The milk of the word is the basics of Christianity and the meat of the word is the more complex stuff.
20,00:01:33.160,00:01:39.639,6.4799957275390625," Before we can get to the meat, the complex, deeper things about the word of God, we need"
21,00:01:39.639,00:01:42.800,3.160003662109375," to understand the basics, the milk."
22,00:01:42.800,00:01:47.959,5.159996032714844," And like it said in Hebrews chapter five, like we just read, there are many Christians"
23,00:01:47.959,00:01:53.839,5.879997253417969, in Paul's day and today that are trying to be teachers when they don't even understand
24,00:01:53.839,00:01:55.019,1.1800003051757812, the basics.
25,00:01:55.019,00:02:01.500,6.480003356933594," As we go into the next chapter, Hebrews chapter six, Paul begins to list out what things are"
26,00:02:01.500,00:02:05.779,4.279998779296875, the basic principles of the prophets of God.
27,00:02:05.779,00:02:12.059,6.279998779296875," Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not"
28,00:02:12.059,00:02:18.860,6.8000030517578125," laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith towards God, of"
29,00:02:18.860,00:02:24.580,5.720001220703125," the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead"
30,00:02:24.580,00:02:27.080,2.5, and of eternal judgment.
31,00:02:27.080,00:02:32.979,5.899993896484375, Everything Paul just listed there in that list is the basic principles of the doctrine
32,00:02:32.979,00:02:33.979,1.0, of Christ.
33,00:02:33.979,00:02:34.979,1.0, He says it himself.
34,00:02:34.979,00:02:42.139,7.160003662109375," Many Christians, for example, like Mike Winger, Gavin Ortland, Radim Zumer, and others, treat"
35,00:02:42.139,00:02:46.899,4.7599945068359375, these basic principles as though they're something up for debate.
36,00:02:46.899,00:02:49.179,2.279998779296875, They're constantly debating these things.
37,00:02:49.179,00:02:53.339,4.160003662109375," But Paul says if you don't even understand these things, you shouldn't even be a teacher."
38,00:02:53.339,00:02:57.860,4.5200042724609375," For example, I mean, Mike Winger is constantly wishy-washy on the basics."
39,00:02:57.860,00:02:59.660,1.8000030517578125, He calls himself a pastor.
40,00:02:59.660,00:03:01.880,2.220001220703125, He's putting himself in a teaching position.
41,00:03:01.880,00:03:03.460,1.5800018310546875, He shouldn't be doing that.
42,00:03:03.460,00:03:08.699,5.239990234375," People who cannot get established on the basics should not be teaching, should not be calling"
43,00:03:08.699,00:03:11.619,2.9199981689453125," themselves pastors, should not be behind a pulpit."
44,00:03:11.619,00:03:16.660,5.040008544921875," And not only this, but most Christians are actually just totally wrong."
45,00:03:16.660,00:03:20.960,4.3000030517578125," If they have a solid position on these issues, they're just wrong about it."
46,00:03:20.960,00:03:25.720,4.7599945068359375, So what I want to do in this video is I want to break down all six of these things and
47,00:03:25.720,00:03:30.320,4.600006103515625, then there's a secret seventh one that we're saving to the end of the video so that you
48,00:03:30.320,00:03:35.559,5.239990234375, guys can be fully furnished and ready to do good works.
49,00:03:35.559,00:03:38.119,2.55999755859375," And by the way, that's what the Bible calls us to do."
50,00:03:38.119,00:03:45.320,7.20001220703125," The Bible calls us Christians to go out and preach the word of God to all nations, making"
51,00:03:45.320,00:03:50.839,5.519989013671875, disciples of all nations and teaching them to obey what Jesus taught.
52,00:03:50.839,00:03:55.059,4.220001220703125," This is the great commission he gives to all of us, not just to some of us."
53,00:03:55.059,00:04:01.440,6.3800048828125," And so we should all be striving to have mastery of the word of God so that we can teach others,"
54,00:04:01.440,00:04:04.399,2.959991455078125, bring others to Christ so that other people can be saved.
55,00:04:04.399,00:04:06.360,1.9600067138671875, And that's the whole reason we're still on the earth.
56,00:04:06.360,00:04:11.240,4.8800048828125, Jesus would rapture us right now if we were not called to this purpose.
57,00:04:11.240,00:04:19.480,8.240005493164062," Anyway, so number one, the first thing that you must understand is repentance from dead works."
58,00:04:19.480,00:04:24.959,5.47998046875," Many Christians, whether they're Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, whatever denomination"
59,00:04:24.959,00:04:31.839,6.8800048828125," they identify as, they all seem to teach that you have to repent of your sins to be saved."
60,00:04:31.839,00:04:34.880,3.040008544921875, But did you know the Bible never teaches that?
61,00:04:34.880,00:04:41.959,7.079986572265625," Not once in the entire King James Bible, Old or New Testament, do we see the phrase repent"
62,00:04:41.959,00:04:45.480,3.52001953125, of your sins or repent from your sins.
63,00:04:45.480,00:04:47.160,1.67999267578125, This never appears.
64,00:04:47.160,00:04:52.000,4.839996337890625, And I'm sure that many people who are watching this video are going to have a bunch of verses
65,00:04:52.000,00:04:56.799,4.79998779296875," come to their mind, open up the King James Bible, read that verse."
66,00:04:56.799,00:05:01.200,4.4000244140625, And what you're going to see is that that verse does not say repent of your sins.
67,00:05:01.200,00:05:06.320,5.1199951171875, There's not a single verse in the Bible that says that because the Bible never teaches
68,00:05:06.320,00:05:08.959,2.639984130859375, repentance of sins for salvation.
69,00:05:08.959,00:05:14.000,5.040008544921875," Now, yes, obviously, once we're saved, we are called to stop sinning."
70,00:05:14.000,00:05:15.779,1.779998779296875, I'm not telling you to keep sinning.
71,00:05:15.779,00:05:20.500,4.720001220703125," But what I'm saying is that for salvation, you don't repent of your sins."
72,00:05:20.500,00:05:24.820,4.32000732421875," See, most Christians, and back then it was most Jews, right?"
73,00:05:24.820,00:05:29.459,4.639984130859375," Have the belief that in order to get to heaven, you have to be a good person, that there's"
74,00:05:29.459,00:05:32.339,2.8800048828125, a certain amount of good works that you have to do.
75,00:05:32.339,00:05:35.140,2.800018310546875," For the Jews, it was keeping the law of Moses."
76,00:05:35.140,00:05:41.779,6.639984130859375," For Catholics, it's getting baptized, taking the Eucharist, getting your death rites, getting"
77,00:05:41.779,00:05:44.859,3.079986572265625," married, the sacraments, repenting of your mortal sins."
78,00:05:44.859,00:05:47.899,3.040008544921875," And for most Christians, it's keeping the Ten Commandments."
79,00:05:47.899,00:05:51.379,3.47998046875, But the Bible teaches we are not saved by works.
80,00:05:51.379,00:05:55.979,4.600006103515625," In Galatians 2.16, it says works cannot justify a man."
81,00:05:55.979,00:06:02.819,6.839996337890625," And in Romans 4.5, it says that we can get to heaven with no good works whatsoever if"
82,00:06:02.819,00:06:05.259,2.44000244140625, we simply just believe in Jesus.
83,00:06:05.259,00:06:10.779,5.519989013671875," An essential thing that you must understand in order to be saved, that in order to go"
84,00:06:10.779,00:06:15.419,4.6400146484375," to heaven, you have to repent of your dead works."
85,00:06:15.419,00:06:19.699,4.279998779296875," Repentance means that you stop doing something, you change your mind about something."
86,00:06:19.699,00:06:25.339,5.6400146484375," And we need to change our mind about good works, thinking that good works get us to"
87,00:06:25.339,00:06:26.339,1.0, heaven.
88,00:06:26.339,00:06:31.699,5.3599853515625," And we need to realize that all of our works are as filthy rags before God, that God thinks"
89,00:06:31.699,00:06:35.379,3.67999267578125," they're totally worthless, and that they will not get us to heaven."
90,00:06:35.379,00:06:38.539,3.160003662109375, We trust in Jesus Christ alone for our salvation.
91,00:06:38.539,00:06:45.099,6.55999755859375," So every time that you see the phrase, repent and believe in the Bible, 99% of the time,"
92,00:06:45.099,00:06:48.099,3.0, it's not talking about turning away from sin.
93,00:06:48.099,00:06:54.299,6.199981689453125," It's talking about repenting of your dead works, that you stop thinking works save you,"
94,00:06:54.299,00:06:56.539,2.240020751953125, and you trust in Jesus Christ alone.
95,00:06:56.539,00:06:59.739,3.199981689453125, The second thing on this list is faith towards God.
96,00:06:59.739,00:07:02.179,2.44000244140625," Now obviously, this is pretty basic, right?"
97,00:07:02.179,00:07:05.219,3.040008544921875," As Christians, we need to understand God is real."
98,00:07:05.219,00:07:10.019,4.79998779296875, And so I recommend that all Christians go and they look up the evidence for God.
99,00:07:10.019,00:07:14.539,4.52001953125, But this is a little deeper because there's more to understand than just God is real.
100,00:07:14.539,00:07:18.619,4.079986572265625," We also have to understand, right, that Jesus Christ is God."
101,00:07:18.619,00:07:23.499,4.8800048828125," If a Christian's denying that Jesus Christ is God, they are unlearned, they are unstable,"
102,00:07:23.499,00:07:26.339,2.839996337890625," they should not be teaching, you shouldn't listen to that person."
103,00:07:26.339,00:07:28.379,2.040008544921875, The Bible is so clear on this.
104,00:07:28.379,00:07:30.779,2.399993896484375," Go to 1 John 5, 7."
105,00:07:30.779,00:07:31.779,1.0, What does it say?
106,00:07:31.779,00:07:37.219,5.44000244140625," It says there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy"
107,00:07:37.219,00:07:38.219,1.0, Ghost.
108,00:07:38.219,00:07:39.739,1.519989013671875, Who is the Word of God?
109,00:07:39.739,00:07:42.259,2.52001953125," Jesus Christ, made in the flesh, right?"
110,00:07:42.259,00:07:45.139,2.8800048828125, So we also have to understand that Jesus is God.
111,00:07:45.139,00:07:49.619,4.47998046875, And another thing that we have to understand is that we put our faith in God in order to
112,00:07:49.619,00:07:50.619,1.0, be saved.
113,00:07:50.619,00:07:54.619,4.0," We put our faith in Jesus Christ alone to be saved, not in our works."
114,00:07:54.619,00:07:58.659,4.040008544921875, The third thing on our list is the doctrine of baptisms.
115,00:07:58.659,00:08:04.339,5.67999267578125," Now something that should immediately stick out to you is that it says baptisms, as in"
116,00:08:04.339,00:08:06.299,1.959991455078125, multiple baptisms.
117,00:08:06.299,00:08:11.219,4.920013427734375," A lot of Christians don't realize this, but there are actually multiple different baptisms"
118,00:08:11.219,00:08:13.699,2.480010986328125, you can get according to the Bible.
119,00:08:13.699,00:08:17.279,3.579986572265625, There's three of them as far as the New Testament is concerned.
120,00:08:17.279,00:08:23.899,6.6199951171875," The baptism of water, baptism of the Holy Ghost, and baptism of fire."
121,00:08:23.899,00:08:26.899,3.0, But only one baptism saves you.
122,00:08:26.899,00:08:32.099,5.20001220703125," Now many Christians, they try to push these three different baptisms together as though"
123,00:08:32.099,00:08:33.419,1.32000732421875, they're one baptism.
124,00:08:33.419,00:08:37.619,4.20001220703125," That when you get baptized in water, you get baptized with the Holy Ghost, and baptism"
125,00:08:37.619,00:08:40.179,2.55999755859375, of the Holy Ghost is baptism of fire.
126,00:08:40.179,00:08:43.379,3.199951171875," But as John the Baptist says in the Gospels,"
127,00:08:43.379,00:08:49.659,6.280029296875," I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, repentance of dead works."
128,00:08:49.659,00:08:55.919,6.260009765625," But he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear."
129,00:08:55.919,00:09:02.419,6.5," But he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and"
130,00:09:02.419,00:09:08.160,5.74005126953125," he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner."
131,00:09:08.160,00:09:12.080,3.91998291015625, But he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
132,00:09:12.080,00:09:15.359,3.27996826171875, So right there the Bible teaches there are three different baptisms.
133,00:09:15.359,00:09:18.540,3.1800537109375," Water baptism, Holy Ghost baptism, fire baptism."
134,00:09:18.540,00:09:23.540,5.0, The first and most important one that I want to mention is the Holy Ghost baptism.
135,00:09:23.540,00:09:28.540,5.0," See when we believe in Jesus, the Holy Ghost comes and indwells us."
136,00:09:28.540,00:09:30.419,1.87994384765625," It says in Ephesians 1.13,"
137,00:09:30.419,00:09:36.260,5.84002685546875," In whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation,"
138,00:09:36.260,00:09:42.580,6.32000732421875," in whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which"
139,00:09:42.580,00:09:47.859,5.27996826171875, is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto
140,00:09:47.859,00:09:49.619,1.760009765625, the praise of his glory.
141,00:09:49.619,00:09:54.780,5.1600341796875," The Bible teaches right there that when we believe in Jesus, that we are indwelled with"
142,00:09:54.780,00:09:59.980,5.20001220703125," the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit seals us until the day of redemption, until"
143,00:09:59.980,00:10:04.739,4.75994873046875," the end of the world, and he's the assurance of our salvation."
144,00:10:04.739,00:10:10.419,5.67999267578125," Holy Ghost baptism, Holy Spirit baptism is what saves you, and it seals you until the"
145,00:10:10.419,00:10:11.419,1.0, day of redemption.
146,00:10:11.419,00:10:13.020,1.60003662109375, You can't lose your salvation.
147,00:10:13.020,00:10:18.660,5.6400146484375," Now after we get baptized with the Holy Ghost, Jesus then commands us to get baptized with"
148,00:10:18.660,00:10:19.660,1.0, water.
149,00:10:19.660,00:10:25.100,5.44000244140625, The whole point of getting baptized with water is so that we can make a public profession
150,00:10:25.100,00:10:29.220,4.1199951171875, to the world that we are choosing to follow Jesus.
151,00:10:29.220,00:10:31.660,2.44000244140625, It's basically like an initiation ritual.
152,00:10:31.660,00:10:33.859,2.199951171875, It's the first step to the Christian life.
153,00:10:33.859,00:10:38.820,4.96002197265625," And then the third baptism, the baptism of fire does not happen to believers, but it"
154,00:10:38.820,00:10:44.220,5.4000244140625," happens to unbelievers when in the day of judgment, people are going to be thrown into"
155,00:10:44.220,00:10:45.220,1.0, hell.
156,00:10:45.220,00:10:48.500,3.27996826171875, The next thing on our list is laying on of hands.
157,00:10:48.500,00:10:54.220,5.72003173828125, Did you know that the Bible teaches that you can cast out demons?
158,00:10:54.220,00:10:58.900,4.67999267578125," Many people don't believe this, the Catholics teach that only bishops can cast out demons,"
159,00:10:58.900,00:11:00.220,1.32000732421875, but this is not true.
160,00:11:00.220,00:11:05.980,5.760009765625," The Bible says that any believer, no matter who you are, that you can cast out demons"
161,00:11:05.980,00:11:08.660,2.67999267578125, through the authority you have been given in Christ.
162,00:11:08.660,00:11:11.540,2.8800048828125," In Mark 16 15, Jesus says,"
163,00:11:11.540,00:11:15.720,4.17999267578125, Go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
164,00:11:15.720,00:11:21.359,5.63995361328125," He that believes and is baptized will be saved, and he that believes not will be damned."
165,00:11:21.359,00:11:24.080,2.72003173828125, And these signs shall follow them that believe.
166,00:11:24.080,00:11:26.600,2.52001953125, In my name they shall cast out devils.
167,00:11:26.600,00:11:28.559,1.9599609375, They shall speak in new tongues.
168,00:11:28.559,00:11:33.320,4.760009765625," They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them."
169,00:11:33.320,00:11:36.520,3.20001220703125, They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.
170,00:11:36.520,00:11:41.640,5.1199951171875," If anyone is telling you that the gifts are not alive in the body, that Christians today"
171,00:11:41.640,00:11:45.760,4.1199951171875," can't perform miracles like casting out demons, they're just wrong."
172,00:11:45.760,00:11:49.159,3.39996337890625, The fact is I've personally seen this in my own life.
173,00:11:49.159,00:11:53.700,4.5400390625, I've seen a demonically possessed man obey the authority of Christ.
174,00:11:53.700,00:11:56.279,2.5799560546875, I command them to start walking around in circles.
175,00:11:56.279,00:11:58.200,1.9200439453125," They get up, they start walking around in circles."
176,00:11:58.200,00:12:01.119,2.91998291015625," I command them to lay on the ground, they lay on the ground."
177,00:12:01.119,00:12:05.359,4.239990234375," You command these demons in the name of Jesus, they have to obey you."
178,00:12:05.359,00:12:12.479,7.1199951171875," God has given all Christians power and authority over sicknesses, over poison, over these things."
179,00:12:12.479,00:12:17.659,5.17999267578125," Now again, the Bible does not say we will always be able to perform every miracle we"
180,00:12:17.659,00:12:22.799,5.1400146484375," want to perform, but the fact is that we can do these things through the power of God if"
181,00:12:22.799,00:12:24.159,1.3599853515625, God wills it.
182,00:12:24.159,00:12:29.039,4.8800048828125," But as Jesus teaches, there are some demons that you can't cast out without prayer and"
183,00:12:29.039,00:12:30.039,1.0, fasting.
184,00:12:30.039,00:12:35.919,5.8800048828125," But still, the point is that we have power and authority in Christ that we can lay hands"
185,00:12:35.919,00:12:37.799,1.8800048828125, on the sick and they will be healed.
186,00:12:37.799,00:12:41.080,3.280029296875, The fifth thing on this list is the resurrection of the dead.
187,00:12:41.080,00:12:46.239,5.15997314453125," Many Christians, mostly just babes in Christ, they envision the afterlife as being like"
188,00:12:46.239,00:12:50.599,4.3599853515625, going up into a cloud and you have a harp and you have some angel wings and a halo and
189,00:12:50.599,00:12:52.640,2.0400390625, it's like a big church service forever.
190,00:12:52.640,00:12:54.400,1.760009765625, This is not what the Bible teaches.
191,00:12:54.400,00:13:00.739,6.3399658203125," The Bible is very clear, good passage is 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, that the dead are"
192,00:13:00.739,00:13:04.880,4.1400146484375, physically going to come back to life in the last days.
193,00:13:04.880,00:13:10.359,5.47998046875," See, as a Christian, we're not waiting for an afterlife where we're just going to be,"
194,00:13:10.359,00:13:11.359,1.0," you know, ghosts."
195,00:13:11.359,00:13:14.760,3.4000244140625," No, we are going to have physical eternal life."
196,00:13:14.760,00:13:20.000,5.239990234375," When Jesus promises eternal life, he's talking about your physical body is going to come"
197,00:13:20.000,00:13:22.119,2.1199951171875, back to life in the last days.
198,00:13:22.119,00:13:27.200,5.08001708984375, And another aspect of this resurrection of the dead is that Jesus came back to life after
199,00:13:27.200,00:13:28.200,1.0, he died.
200,00:13:28.200,00:13:30.960,2.760009765625," Three days after he died, he rose from the dead."
201,00:13:30.960,00:13:34.919,3.9599609375," And if a Christian is denying this, they're not saved, at least in my opinion."
202,00:13:34.919,00:13:40.119,5.20001220703125," And just like how Jesus came back to life three days after he died, we are going to"
203,00:13:40.119,00:13:45.739,5.6199951171875, come back to life after we die when Jesus comes back during the second coming.
204,00:13:45.739,00:13:51.320,5.58001708984375," If you want deeper wisdom on this, I have a video about whether hell is eternal and"
205,00:13:51.320,00:13:56.239,4.91998291015625," in this, I go really deep into this discussion about the resurrection of the dead, the new"
206,00:13:56.239,00:13:59.599,3.3599853515625," earth and heaven and what it all looks like, what's it all about."
207,00:13:59.599,00:14:04.200,4.60003662109375," And there's actually two different hells in the Bible, but go watch that video if you're"
208,00:14:04.200,00:14:05.200,1.0, interested.
209,00:14:05.200,00:14:09.279,4.0799560546875," And our final point, at least in this list that Paul gives us, though I have one more"
210,00:14:09.279,00:14:14.320,5.0400390625," seventh point that you need to know, has to do with hell and that's eternal judgment."
211,00:14:14.320,00:14:20.640,6.32000732421875," Listen, many Christians don't like this, but the fact is that once you die, your eternal"
212,00:14:20.640,00:14:22.659,2.01995849609375, destiny is sealed.
213,00:14:22.659,00:14:26.400,3.74005126953125," Whether you are going to heaven, whether you're going to hell, whether you are partaking in"
214,00:14:26.400,00:14:30.760,4.3599853515625," the resurrection of the dead or whether you're going to the lake of fire, our judgments are"
215,00:14:30.760,00:14:32.039,1.27996826171875, eternal.
216,00:14:32.039,00:14:33.580,1.5400390625, They cannot be changed.
217,00:14:33.580,00:14:37.960,4.3800048828125," And the Bible's pretty clear that if you are saved, if you've put your faith and trust"
218,00:14:37.960,00:14:43.119,5.15997314453125," in Jesus Christ alone for your salvation and you're not trusting your works and you say,"
219,00:14:43.119,00:14:46.359,3.239990234375," Jesus, I believe you are the reason I'm going to heaven."
220,00:14:46.359,00:14:47.559,1.20001220703125, It's not about me.
221,00:14:47.559,00:14:48.559,1.0, It's not my works.
222,00:14:48.559,00:14:49.760,1.20001220703125, It's not my repentance.
223,00:14:49.760,00:14:55.520,5.760009765625," If you believe that, you are eternally secure and you can never lose your salvation."
224,00:14:55.520,00:15:00.320,4.79998779296875," Our judgment, whether it's a good judgment or a bad judgment, is eternal."
225,00:15:00.320,00:15:05.080,4.760009765625," You cannot lose your salvation and the people who are dead who haven't believed in Christ,"
226,00:15:05.080,00:15:06.720,1.6400146484375, they don't get a second chance.
227,00:15:06.720,00:15:09.520,2.79998779296875, You're not going to get a second chance to believe in Jesus.
228,00:15:09.520,00:15:14.280,4.760009765625," Now I'm sure people got to be asking by now, Luis Sanz, what's the seventh secret thing?"
229,00:15:14.280,00:15:19.880,5.5999755859375," Well, the seventh thing that I think all Christians need to know is what the distinction between"
230,00:15:19.880,00:15:21.920,2.0400390625, the milk and the meat is.
231,00:15:21.920,00:15:24.440,2.51995849609375," Listen, we've already described what the milk is."
232,00:15:24.440,00:15:27.760,3.32000732421875," These six things that we just talked about, they are the milk."
233,00:15:27.760,00:15:29.799,2.03997802734375, These are the basics of Christianity.
234,00:15:29.799,00:15:33.600,3.800048828125," Essentially what this list is, is it's the gospel."
235,00:15:33.600,00:15:38.559,4.9599609375," That God is real, that God is going to judge all people for their sins when they die."
236,00:15:38.559,00:15:40.739,2.17999267578125," Good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell."
237,00:15:40.739,00:15:46.820,6.08001708984375," But if we believe in Jesus and trust in him alone, we can have forgiveness for our sins"
238,00:15:46.820,00:15:48.179,1.3599853515625, and we won't go to hell.
239,00:15:48.179,00:15:51.020,2.84002685546875, And we have eternal life that we can never lose.
240,00:15:51.020,00:15:53.179,2.15997314453125, This is the basics of Christianity.
241,00:15:53.179,00:15:57.220,4.0400390625, All people have to grasp this before they can move on to the meat.
242,00:15:57.220,00:15:59.340,2.1199951171875," But the question is, what is the meat?"
243,00:15:59.340,00:16:04.340,5.0," Well, if we head back to Hebrews chapter 5 and go down to the very last verse there,"
244,00:16:04.340,00:16:11.420,7.08001708984375," Strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have"
245,00:16:11.420,00:16:16.720,5.29998779296875, their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
246,00:16:16.720,00:16:22.100,5.3800048828125," The meat of the word, believe it or not, most Christians will try to invert this for you."
247,00:16:22.100,00:16:23.900,1.79998779296875," This as above, so below."
248,00:16:23.900,00:16:28.700,4.79998779296875, And they try to tell you that the basics of Christianity is repenting of your sins.
249,00:16:28.700,00:16:29.700,1.0, You stop sinning.
250,00:16:29.700,00:16:31.340,1.6400146484375, You overcome your sin.
251,00:16:31.340,00:16:36.220,4.8800048828125," You know, this complicated stuff is like the resurrection, the dead, and heaven, and hell,"
252,00:16:36.220,00:16:37.220,1.0, and all that.
253,00:16:37.220,00:16:42.260,5.03997802734375," No, the Bible says the basics is salvation through faith alone and Christ alone."
254,00:16:42.260,00:16:45.260,3.0, That there's eternal judgment for your sins and all that.
255,00:16:45.260,00:16:51.980,6.72003173828125," And that the advanced, complex stuff is discerning good from evil, overcoming your sins, repenting"
256,00:16:51.980,00:16:57.059,5.0799560546875," from your sins, obeying God, obedience to God, walking in the spirit."
257,00:16:57.059,00:16:59.340,2.280029296875, That's the advanced stuff.
258,00:16:59.340,00:17:00.340,1.0, That's the meat.
259,00:17:00.340,00:17:05.960,5.6199951171875," And many Christians, they get confused about this because there's so many false teachers"
260,00:17:05.960,00:17:11.260,5.300048828125, and they want to delve into the meat when they're not ready to chew the meat.
261,00:17:11.260,00:17:14.980,3.719970703125," Just like how a baby, they don't have any teeth, they can't chew anything, they need"
262,00:17:14.980,00:17:17.340,2.3599853515625, to drink milk in order to live.
263,00:17:17.340,00:17:19.740,2.4000244140625," Babes in Christ, we're a babe in Christ."
264,00:17:19.740,00:17:25.720,5.97998046875, We cannot comprehend the deeper things of the word of God that have to do with repentance
265,00:17:25.720,00:17:29.899,4.179931640625," from sins, overcoming our struggles with addictions, and stuff like that."
266,00:17:29.899,00:17:32.340,2.4400634765625, That's advanced stuff for Christians.
267,00:17:32.340,00:17:33.799,1.4599609375, That's not the basics.
268,00:17:33.799,00:17:40.539,6.739990234375," And I see many Christians who are not solid on the basics, not solid on the milk, they"
269,00:17:40.539,00:17:43.299,2.760009765625, delve into deep meat.
270,00:17:43.299,00:17:49.100,5.800048828125," Books like the book of James, the book of 1 John, the book of Jude, the book of Hebrews."
271,00:17:49.100,00:17:54.179,5.0799560546875," They delve into these books, for the most part, are entirely talking about the Christian"
272,00:17:54.179,00:17:55.179,1.0," life, right?"
273,00:17:55.179,00:17:57.380,2.2000732421875, And what is the Christian life like for a Christian?
274,00:17:57.380,00:18:02.419,5.0399169921875," Well, as a Christian, we're supposed to walk in obedience to God, repent from our sins,"
275,00:18:02.419,00:18:03.899,1.47998046875, and preach the gospel.
276,00:18:03.899,00:18:09.100,5.2000732421875," But because they're not solid on the basics, right, that salvation is by faith alone, in"
277,00:18:09.100,00:18:13.299,4.199951171875," Christ alone, and that it's all about what Jesus did, it's not about our works."
278,00:18:13.299,00:18:17.700,4.4000244140625, They read these books about the Christian life and they get confused and they end up
279,00:18:17.700,00:18:21.980,4.280029296875, thinking that salvation is by works when that's not what these books are teaching.
280,00:18:21.980,00:18:29.299,7.3199462890625, All that James or 1 John or Hebrews is teaching is that as a Christian we should not sin and
281,00:18:29.299,00:18:31.200,1.9000244140625, we should do good works.
282,00:18:31.200,00:18:36.659,5.4599609375, But babes in Christ who are not solid on the gospel can't handle being told that they have
283,00:18:36.659,00:18:37.659,1.0, to do good works.
284,00:18:37.659,00:18:43.340,5.6800537109375, They think that this is some kind of salvational requirement when it's not a salvational requirement.
285,00:18:43.340,00:18:49.340,6.0, This is deeper stuff that we're supposed to come to after we establish the basics.
286,00:18:49.340,00:18:54.539,5.199951171875, So the seventh thing that all Christians need to know is that we need to interpret
287,00:18:54.539,00:19:01.260,6.7200927734375," these difficult passages like James chapter 2, like 1 John, like Hebrews chapter 10, and"
288,00:19:01.260,00:19:04.640,3.3800048828125," Hebrews 6, Hebrews 3, Galatians chapter 5."
289,00:19:04.640,00:19:11.019,6.3798828125, We need to interpret these passages which are difficult through the lens of the milk.
290,00:19:11.019,00:19:16.899,5.8800048828125, We need to look at these passages with a full assurance that salvation is by faith alone
291,00:19:16.899,00:19:25.299,8.4000244140625," without works, sola gratia, grace alone, sola fide, faith alone, sola Christus, Christ alone."
292,00:19:25.299,00:19:31.019,5.719970703125, And once you guys fully grasp that then it's time to go to these deeper passages.
293,00:19:31.019,00:19:35.299,4.280029296875, But when you don't fully grasp the basics you're not going to be able to grasp these
294,00:19:35.299,00:19:36.299,1.0, deeper things.
295,00:19:36.299,00:19:41.460,5.1600341796875," And listen, as a Christian you might disagree with me on my understanding of salvation but"
296,00:19:41.460,00:19:46.700,5.239990234375," I have to ask you, what is Hebrews 6 talking about when it says repentance from dead works?"
297,00:19:46.700,00:19:50.140,3.4400634765625, What is it talking about when it says that our judgment is eternal?
298,00:19:50.140,00:19:55.059,4.919921875, What does it mean in Hebrews chapter 5 when it says that the meat is discerning good and evil?
299,00:19:55.059,00:19:59.840,4.780029296875," Regardless, Hebrews 5 and 6 tells us that we need to understand these issues before"
300,00:19:59.840,00:20:03.100,3.260009765625, we can get into discerning good and evil.
301,00:20:03.100,00:20:06.659,3.5599365234375, So perhaps you're not convinced salvation is by faith alone.
302,00:20:06.659,00:20:11.240,4.580078125," But until you understand how salvation works, you can't be lecturing people and trying"
303,00:20:11.240,00:20:16.179,4.93994140625, to teach people about the word of God and you can't be dealing with the complex issues
304,00:20:16.179,00:20:17.179,1.0, of morality.
305,00:20:17.179,00:20:21.779,4.5999755859375," If you want to support the ministry, send a super thanks, it's that little heart with"
306,00:20:21.779,00:20:23.299,1.52001953125, the dollar sign thing.
307,00:20:23.299,00:20:25.380,2.080078125," Or just leave a comment, like the video."
308,00:20:25.380,00:20:26.380,1.0, Thanks for watching.
309,00:20:26.380,00:20:27.179,0.7999267578125, See you next time.
