And I'm not trying to be edgy or anything when I say this, there are so many Christians out here who don't even know the basics of Christianity, but then go around purporting themselves to be Bible teachers, going around condemning others to hell and doing all kinds of other wicked stuff when they don't even know what the Bible teaches. They don't even know the fundamentals of the faith. So whether you're a babe in Christ or you've been a Christian, you're well seasoned many years in, I think that there's something to take away from this video for everyone.

I mean, even for me, I've been a Christian going on for like four years now and only just, I don't know, maybe like two years ago, I learned about some of these things because these things really aren't taught in any churches, even though every church should be teaching these things. So in Hebrews chapter five, verse 12, it says this for when the time came that you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God and are become as such that have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe.

The Bible talks about this distinction between the milk of the word and the meat of the word. The milk of the word is the basics of Christianity and the meat of the word is the more complex stuff. Before we can get to the meat, the complex, deeper things about the word of God, we need to understand the basics, the milk. And like it said in Hebrews chapter five, like we just read, there are many Christians in Paul's day and today that are trying to be teachers when they don't even understand the basics. As we go into the next chapter, Hebrews chapter six, Paul begins to list out what things are the basic principles of the prophets of God.

Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith towards God, of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment. Everything Paul just listed there in that list is the basic principles of the doctrine of Christ. He says it himself. Many Christians, for example, like Mike Winger, Gavin Ortland, Radim Zumer, and others, treat these basic principles as though they're something up for debate. They're constantly debating these things. But Paul says if you don't even understand these things, you shouldn't even be a teacher.
        Copy



For example, I mean, Mike Winger is constantly wishy-washy on the basics. He calls himself a pastor. He's putting himself in a teaching position. He shouldn't be doing that. People who cannot get established on the basics should not be teaching, should not be calling themselves pastors, should not be behind a pulpit. And not only this, but most Christians are actually just totally wrong. If they have a solid position on these issues, they're just wrong about it. So what I want to do in this video is I want to break down all six of these things and then there's a secret seventh one that we're saving to the end of the video so that you guys can be fully furnished and ready to do good works.

And by the way, that's what the Bible calls us to do. The Bible calls us Christians to go out and preach the word of God to all nations, making disciples of all nations and teaching them to obey what Jesus taught. This is the great commission he gives to all of us, not just to some of us. And so we should all be striving to have mastery of the word of God so that we can teach others, bring others to Christ so that other people can be saved. And that's the whole reason we're still on the earth. Jesus would rapture us right now if we were not called to this purpose.

Anyway, so number one, the first thing that you must understand is repentance from dead works. Many Christians, whether they're Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, whatever denomination they identify as, they all seem to teach that you have to repent of your sins to be saved. But did you know the Bible never teaches that? Not once in the entire King James Bible, Old or New Testament, do we see the phrase repent of your sins or repent from your sins. This never appears. And I'm sure that many people who are watching this video are going to have a bunch of verses come to their mind, open up the King James Bible, read that verse.
        Copy



And what you're going to see is that that verse does not say repent of your sins. There's not a single verse in the Bible that says that because the Bible never teaches repentance of sins for salvation. Now, yes obviously once we're saved, we are called to stop sinning. I'm not telling you to keep sinning. But what I'm saying is that for salvation you don't repent of your sins. See most Christians (and back then it was most Jews), have the belief that in order to get to heaven you have to be a good person, that there's a certain amount of good works that you have to do.
        Copy



For the Jews it was keeping the law of Moses. For Catholics it's getting baptized, taking the Eucharist, getting your death rites, getting married, the sacraments, repenting of your mortal sins. And for most Christians it's keeping the Ten Commandments. But the Bible teaches we are not saved by works. In Galatians 2:16 it says works cannot justify a man. And in Romans 4:5 it says that we can get to heaven with no good works whatsoever if we simply just believe in Jesus.
        Copy



An essential thing that you must understand in order to be saved is that in order to go to heaven you have to repent of your dead works. Repentance means that you stop doing something; you change your mind about something. And we need to change our mind about good works thinking that good works get us to heaven. And we need to realize that all of our works are as filthy rags before God; that God thinks they're totally worthless; and that they will not get us to heaven. We trust in Jesus Christ alone for our salvation.
        Copy



So every time that you see the phrase repent and believe in the Bible 99% of the time it's not talking about turning away from sin. It's talking about repenting of your dead works; that you stop thinking works save you and you trust in Jesus Christ alone.
        Copy



The second thing on this list is faith towards God. Now obviously this is pretty basic right? As Christians we need to understand God is real and so I recommend that all Christians go and they look up the evidence for God. But this is a little deeper because there's more to understand than just God is real. We also have to understand right? That Jesus Christ is God if a Christian's denying that Jesus Christ is God they are unlearned they are unstable they should not be teaching you shouldn't listen to that person.
        Copy



The Bible is so clear on this go to 1 John 5:7 What does it say? It says there are three that bear record in heaven; The Father The Word; and The Holy Ghost Who is The Word of God? Jesus Christ made in flesh right? So we also have to understand that Jesus is God.
        Copy



And another thing that we have to understand is that we put our faith in God in order to be saved we put our faith in Jesus Christ alone to be saved not in our works.
        Copy



The third thing on our list is The Doctrine Of Baptisms now something that should immediately stick out to you is that it says baptisms as in multiple baptisms a lot of Christians don't realize this but there are actually multiple different baptisms you can get according to The Bible there's three of them as far as New Testament is concerned; The Baptism Of Water Baptism Of The Holy Ghost and Baptism Of Fire but only one baptism saves you now many Christians they try push these three different baptisms together as though they're one baptism; That when you get baptized with water; You get baptized with The Holy Ghost and Baptism Of The Holy Ghost Baptism Of Fire but as John The Baptist says in The Gospels I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance.
        Copy



Repentance Of Dead Works But he that comes after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy bear But he will baptize you with The Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand he will thoroughly purge his floor gather his wheat into garner He will burn up chaff with unquenchable fire So right there Bible teaches three different baptisms Water Baptism Holy Ghost Baptism Fire Baptism The first most important one I want mention is Holy Ghost Baptism see when we believe in Jesus Holy Ghost comes indwells us says in Ephesians 1:13 In whom also trusted after heard word truth gospel salvation whom also after believed sealed with Holy Spirit promise which earnest inheritance until redemption purchased possession unto praise glory
        Copy



The Bible teaches right there when believe in Jesus indwelled with Holy Spirit Holy Spirit seals until day redemption until end world he's assurance salvation Holy Ghost Baptism Holy Spirit Baptism what saves seals until day redemption can't lose salvation now after get baptized Holy Ghost Jesus then commands get baptized water whole point getting baptized water make public profession world choosing follow Jesus basically like initiation ritual first step Christian life then third baptism baptism fire does not believers happens unbelievers day judgment people thrown hell
        Copy



The next thing on our list is laying on hands Did know Bible teaches can cast out demons Many people don't believe Catholics teach only bishops cast out demons but not true Bible says any believer no matter who are can cast out demons through authority given Christ In Mark 16:15 Jesus says Go into all world preach gospel every creature He believes baptized saved but believes not damned And these signs follow them believe In my name shall cast out devils shall speak new tongues shall take up serpents if drink deadly thing hurt them shall lay hands sick recover
        Copy



If anyone telling gifts not alive body Christians today can't perform miracles like casting out demons just wrong fact personally seen own life seen demonically possessed man obey authority Christ command start walking around circles they get up start walking around circles command lay ground lay ground command demons name Jesus have obey God given Christians power authority sicknesses poison things Now again Bible does not say will always able perform every miracle want perform fact can do things power God if God wills it But as Jesus teaches some demons can't cast without prayer fasting point power authority Christ lay hands sick healed

The fifth thing on this list is resurrection dead Many Christians mostly babes Christ envision afterlife going cloud harp angel wings halo big church service forever This not what Bible teaches good passage 1 Thessalonians 4 dead physically come back life last days See Christian waiting afterlife just going ghosts No going have physical eternal life When Jesus promises eternal life talking physical body going come back life last days
        Copy



Another aspect resurrection dead Jesus came back life after died Three days after died rose from dead If Christian denying this not saved least opinion Just like how Jesus came back life three days after died going come back life after die when Jesus comes back during second coming If want deeper wisdom whether hell eternal really deep discussion resurrection dead new earth heaven looks like what's about And actually two different hells Bible but watch video interested
        Copy



And final point least list Paul gives though one more seventh point need know has do hell That's eternal judgment Listen many Christians don't like fact once die eternal destiny sealed Whether going heaven going hell whether partaking resurrection dead whether lake fire judgments eternal cannot changed Bible clear saved put faith trust Jesus Christ alone salvation not trusting works say Jesus believe reason going heaven not about me works repentance If believe eternally secure never lose salvation Judgment whether good judgment bad judgment eternal cannot lose salvation people dead haven't believed Christ don't second chance not going get second chance believe Jesus
