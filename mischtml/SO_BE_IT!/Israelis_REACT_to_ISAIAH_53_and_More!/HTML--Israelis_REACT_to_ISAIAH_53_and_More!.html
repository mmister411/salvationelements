            <p>Okay listen closely. He was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. Punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed. By his wounds we are healed. So where is this from? The Old Testament or the New Testament? I'm gonna say the other one because it doesn't sound like the Tanakh. New Testament. Old Testament. Tanakh.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Why do you think that's from the New Testament? It sounded like they were talking about Jesus. I don't know why. It's a feeling. I can't say why. It's from the Old Testament. All that I knew is a trick. It's no trick. I'm telling you it's so similar. People think that it's like a Western religion and it has nothing to do with Judaism but this is so close to Judaism it's crazy.

            <p>So the next one you ready? For to us a child is born, a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, New Testament. Again I would assume that this one is from the New Testament I think. The other one. What's it called? New Testament. The New Testament. Something about the Prince of Peace. Right. Like it got me right away. No I mean yeah it definitely sounds like New Testament stuff.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Excellent. Tanakh. One more. They will look on me whom they have pierced and they will mourn for him. I'm gonna say as one mourns for an only son and they will weep bitterly over him like the bitter weeping of a firstborn. I mean I'm gonna say New Testament but it's probably Old Testament. Yeah that's right.

            <p>Can I ask you why did you think that the parts sounded like New Testament? Oh it sounded like he was getting pierced to the cross or something. And this is 700 years before Jesus is born. Who is he talking about?

            <p>Last one. For I'm not ashamed of the gospel. To everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek. I mean I'm gonna say the new again but is it the old? This is the New Testament. Oh this is the new. I don't think they were talking too much about Greeks in the Old Testament. Yes. You got it. You got it.

            <p>You initially thought it was from the Tanakh and why? You know we are the chosen ones by God. Yes. And something about talking about the non-Jews is more modern. That's a great point. Did you know that that God told Abraham that from him, from his seed, will become a great blessing to all the nations? Wow. I didn't know that.

            <p>Yeah so this is why we're here because we want people to understand that the Tanakh gives a promise and the New Testament fulfills that promise in Yeshua. Like Yeshua he's the only person that can fit the description of the Mashiach. Only person.

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>And so we're trying to teach people that, Regha, open the eyes and look for yourselves. Read some of the Tanakh. Read the New Testament. You can see for yourself what it's talking about because we feel that our life is on the line here.
