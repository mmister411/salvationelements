

Okay listen closely. He was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. Punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed. By his wounds we are healed. So where is this from? The Old Testament or the New Testament? I'm gonna say the other one because it doesn't sound like the Tanakh. New Testament. Old Testament. Tanakh.
        Copy



Why do you think that's from the New Testament? It sounded like they were talking about Jesus. I don't know why. It's a feeling. I can't say why. It's from the Old Testament. All that I knew is a trick. It's no trick. I'm telling you it's so similar. People think that it's like a Western religion and it has nothing to do with Judaism but this is so close to Judaism it's crazy.
        Copy



So the next one you ready? For to us a child is born, a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, New Testament. Again I would assume that this one is from the New Testament I think. The other one. What's it called? New Testament. The New Testament. Something about the Prince of Peace. Right. Like it got me right away. No I mean yeah it definitely sounds like New Testament stuff.
        Copy



Excellent. Tanakh. One more. They will look on me whom they have pierced and they will mourn for him. I'm gonna say as one mourns for an only son and they will weep bitterly over him like the bitter weeping of a firstborn. I mean I'm gonna say New Testament but it's probably Old Testament. Yeah that's right.
        Copy



Can I ask you why did you think that the parts sounded like New Testament? Oh it sounded like he was getting pierced to the cross or something. And this is 700 years before Jesus is born. Who is he talking about?
        Copy



Last one. For I'm not ashamed of the gospel. To everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek. I mean I'm gonna say the new again but is it the old? This is the New Testament. Oh this is the new. I don't think they were talking too much about Greeks in the Old Testament. Yes. You got it. You got it.
        Copy



The New Testament. You're right. Bro we got four for four. Four for four. You win. You win the Brit HaChadasha.
        Copy



You initially thought it was from the Tanakh and why? You know we are the chosen ones by God. Yes. And something about talking about the non-Jews is more modern. That's a great point. Did you know that that God told Abraham that from him, from his seed, will become a great blessing to all the nations? Wow. I didn't know that.
        Copy



Yeah so this is why we're here because we want people to understand that the Tanakh gives a promise and the New Testament fulfills that promise in Yeshua. Like Yeshua he's the only person that can fit the description of the Mashiach. Only person.
        Copy



And so we're trying to teach people that, Regha, open the eyes and look for yourselves. Read some of the Tanakh. Read the New Testament. You can see for yourself what it's talking about because we feel that our life is on the line here.
        Copy



And so if people aren't thinking about how they can secure their future with God and their last day comes it's scary. So we just want to share with people where they can find eternal salvation and forgiveness.
        Copy



Yeah so if you're interested we have a New Testament in Hebrew we can give to you for you to read. Really? Yeah. Why not? Okay. I'd love to.
        Copy



Cool. Let me get it for you.
        Copy



You might want to actually start in the in the Tanakh on the last book. Malachi. And go right into here.
        Copy



All right. And you'll see a narrative that takes you from here to there. It's very smooth. It's a smooth transition. It's wonderful.
        Copy



And read this because this is for our Jewish people.
        Copy



If you open it up and you read the first verse, open it up, Read the first verse of the New Testament.
        Copy



Okay.
        Copy



So does this sound like something foreign to our Jewish people? Does that sound like something Zahar? Not at all.
        Copy



Something foreign? Something from the Christians? It's theirs. It's not ours?
        Copy



No.
        Copy



It sounds mine. It sounds very Jewish.
        Copy



Right.
        Copy



And all you needed to do is look at the very first sentence to find out.
        Copy



Yeah.
        Copy



So look through that and you can contact us if you want to if you have any questions.
        Copy



Amazing.
        Copy



All right.
        Copy



Thank you very much.
        Copy



You are amazing.
        Copy


        
>
    
        
Thank you.
        Copy



I think you need a lot of faith to say that this has nothing to do with Judaism.
        Copy



Yeah and it's important for us to be able to share with our Jewish people the Jewishness of the New Testament and not the fact that it's just Jewish but that it delivers on the promises of the Old Testament.
        Copy



Yeah.
        Copy



I loved how people were so surprised to see prophecies that were happening 700 years before Jesus and think that it was written in the New Testament.
        Copy



Right.
        Copy



And we didn't even tell them that it was Jesus. They just said this looks like Jesus.
        Copy



How can this not be Jesus?
        Copy



That needs to be the question.
        Copy



Exactly.
        Copy



Exactly.
