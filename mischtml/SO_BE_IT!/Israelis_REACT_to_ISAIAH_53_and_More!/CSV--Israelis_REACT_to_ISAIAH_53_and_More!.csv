0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.840,5.840000152587891, Okay listen closely. He was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for
1,00:00:05.840,00:00:10.319,4.479999542236328, our iniquities. Punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we
2,00:00:10.319,00:00:14.520,4.200000762939453, are healed. By his wounds we are healed. So where is this from? The Old Testament
3,00:00:14.520,00:00:17.440,2.9200000762939453, or the New Testament? I'm gonna say the other one because it doesn't sound like
4,00:00:17.440,00:00:28.959,11.519998550415039, the Tanakh. New Testament. Old Testament. Tanakh. Why do you think that's from the
5,00:00:28.959,00:00:35.040,6.0800018310546875, New Testament? It sounded like they were talking about Jesus.
6,00:00:35.040,00:00:41.040,6.0, I don't know why. It's a feeling. I can't say why. It's from the Old Testament. All that I knew is a trick.
7,00:00:41.040,00:00:44.279,3.2399978637695312, It's no trick. I'm telling you it's so similar. People think that it's like a
8,00:00:44.279,00:00:48.200,3.920001983642578, Western religion and it has nothing to do with Judaism but this is so close to
9,00:00:48.200,00:00:53.479,5.279998779296875," Judaism it's crazy. So the next one you ready? For to us a child is born, a son is"
10,00:00:53.479,00:01:01.040,7.560001373291016," given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, Everlasting Father, Prince"
11,00:01:01.040,00:01:07.599,6.55999755859375," of Peace, New Testament. Again I would assume that this one is from the New Testament I think."
12,00:01:07.599,00:01:13.639,6.040000915527344, The other one. What's it called? New Testament. The New Testament. Something about the Prince of Peace.
13,00:01:13.639,00:01:19.720,6.0800018310546875, Right. Like it got me right away. No I mean yeah it definitely sounds like New
14,00:01:19.720,00:01:29.559,9.839996337890625, Testament stuff. Excellent. Tanakh. One more. They will look on me whom they have
15,00:01:29.559,00:01:36.159,6.599998474121094, pierced and they will mourn for him. I'm gonna say as one mourns for an only son
16,00:01:36.159,00:01:40.760,4.600006103515625, and they will weep bitterly over him like the bitter weeping of a firstborn.
17,00:01:40.760,00:01:46.159,5.399993896484375, I mean I'm gonna say New Testament but it's probably Old Testament. Yeah that's
18,00:01:46.159,00:01:48.239,2.0800018310546875, right. Can I ask you why did you think that the
19,00:01:48.239,00:01:53.639,5.400001525878906, parts sounded like New Testament? Oh it sounded like he was getting pierced to the cross or something.
20,00:01:53.639,00:01:58.879,5.239997863769531, And this is 700 years before Jesus is born. Who is he talking about? Last one.
21,00:01:58.879,00:02:03.839,4.959999084472656, For I'm not ashamed of the gospel. To everyone who believes to the Jew
22,00:02:03.839,00:02:10.439,6.599998474121094, first and also to the Greek. I mean I'm gonna say the new again but is it the old?
23,00:02:10.439,00:02:14.200,3.760009765625, This is the New Testament. Oh this is the new. I don't think they were talking too much
24,00:02:14.200,00:02:20.840,6.6399993896484375, about Greeks in the Old Testament. Yes. You got it. You got it. The New Testament.
25,00:02:20.840,00:02:27.400,6.55999755859375, You're right. Bro we got four for four. Four for four. You win. You win the
26,00:02:27.400,00:02:33.879,6.4799957275390625, Brit HaChadasha. You initially thought it was from the Tanakh and why? You know we are
27,00:02:33.879,00:02:39.840,5.9600067138671875, the chosen ones by God. Yes. And something about talking about the non-Jews
28,00:02:39.840,00:02:45.319,5.4799957275390625, is more modern. That's a great point. Did you know that that God told Abraham
29,00:02:45.319,00:02:51.840,6.5200042724609375," that from him, from his seed, will become a great blessing to all the"
30,00:02:51.840,00:02:56.560,4.720001220703125, nations? Wow. I didn't know that. Yeah so this is why we're here because we want
31,00:02:56.560,00:03:00.840,4.279998779296875, people to understand that the Tanakh gives a promise and the New Testament
32,00:03:00.840,00:03:05.440,4.600006103515625, fulfills that promise in Yeshua. Like Yeshua he's the only person that can fit
33,00:03:05.440,00:03:09.400,3.959991455078125, the description of the Mashiach. Only person. And so we're trying to teach
34,00:03:09.400,00:03:14.200,4.8000030517578125," people that, Regha, open the eyes and look for yourselves. Read some of the"
35,00:03:14.200,00:03:17.120,2.9199981689453125, Tanakh. Read the New Testament. You can see for yourself what it's talking about
36,00:03:17.120,00:03:21.800,4.6800079345703125, because we feel that our life is on the line here. And so if people aren't
37,00:03:21.800,00:03:25.840,4.0399932861328125, thinking about how they can secure their future with God and their last day comes
38,00:03:25.840,00:03:31.640,5.8000030517578125, it's scary. So we just want to share with people where they can find eternal
39,00:03:31.640,00:03:36.040,4.399993896484375, salvation and forgiveness. Yeah so if you're interested we have a New
40,00:03:36.040,00:03:39.560,3.5200042724609375, Testament in Hebrew we can give to you for you to read. Really? Yeah. Why not? Okay.
41,00:03:39.560,00:03:43.520,3.9600067138671875, I'd love to. Cool. Let me get it for you. You might want to actually start in the
42,00:03:43.520,00:03:49.080,5.55999755859375, in the Tanakh on the last book. Malachi. And go right into here. All right. And
43,00:03:49.080,00:03:53.280,4.1999969482421875, you'll see a narrative that takes you from here to there. It's very smooth. It's
44,00:03:53.280,00:03:57.120,3.839996337890625, a smooth transition. It's wonderful. And read this because this is for our
45,00:03:57.120,00:04:01.000,3.8800048828125," Jewish people. If you open it up and you read the first verse, open it up,"
46,00:04:01.000,00:04:03.000,2.0, Read the first verse of the New Testament.
47,00:04:03.000,00:04:08.680,5.6800079345703125, Okay. So does this sound like something foreign to our Jewish people? Does that
48,00:04:08.680,00:04:14.400,5.720001220703125, sound like something Zahar? Not at all. Something foreign? Something from the
49,00:04:14.400,00:04:20.000,5.600006103515625, Christians? It's theirs. It's not ours? No. It sounds mine. It sounds very Jewish. Right. And all you
50,00:04:20.000,00:04:24.600,4.600006103515625, needed to do is look at the very first sentence to find out. Yeah. So look
51,00:04:24.600,00:04:28.120,3.52001953125, through that and you can contact us if you want to if you have any questions.
52,00:04:28.120,00:04:34.080,5.959991455078125, Amazing. All right. Thank you very much. You are amazing. Thank you. I think you need a lot of
53,00:04:34.080,00:04:38.080,4.0, faith to say that this has nothing to do with Judaism. Yeah and it's important for
54,00:04:38.080,00:04:41.180,3.100006103515625, us to be able to share with our Jewish people the Jewishness of the New
55,00:04:41.180,00:04:44.400,3.220001220703125, Testament and not the fact that it's just Jewish but that it delivers on the
56,00:04:44.400,00:04:48.480,4.079986572265625, promises of the Old Testament. Yeah. I loved how people were so surprised to
57,00:04:48.480,00:04:54.480,6.0, see prophecies that were happening 700 years before Jesus and think that it was
58,00:04:54.480,00:04:57.080,2.600006103515625, written in the New Testament. Right. And we didn't even tell them that it was
59,00:04:57.080,00:05:00.600,3.519989013671875, Jesus. They just said this looks like Jesus. How can this not be Jesus? That
60,00:05:00.600,00:05:05.120,4.52001953125, needs to be the question. Exactly. Exactly. I hope you guys enjoy this type of video.
