00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 Okay listen closely. He was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.319
 our iniquities. Punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.520
 are healed. By his wounds we are healed. So where is this from? The Old Testament

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.440
 or the New Testament? I'm gonna say the other one because it doesn't sound like

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:28.959
 the Tanakh. New Testament. Old Testament. Tanakh. Why do you think that's from the

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:35.040
 New Testament? It sounded like they were talking about Jesus.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 I don't know why. It's a feeling. I can't say why. It's from the Old Testament. All that I knew is a trick.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.279
 It's no trick. I'm telling you it's so similar. People think that it's like a

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:48.200
 Western religion and it has nothing to do with Judaism but this is so close to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.479
 Judaism it's crazy. So the next one you ready? For to us a child is born, a son is

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:01.040
 given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, Everlasting Father, Prince

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.599
 of Peace, New Testament. Again I would assume that this one is from the New Testament I think.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:13.639
 The other one. What's it called? New Testament. The New Testament. Something about the Prince of Peace.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:19.720
 Right. Like it got me right away. No I mean yeah it definitely sounds like New

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:29.559
 Testament stuff. Excellent. Tanakh. One more. They will look on me whom they have

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:36.159
 pierced and they will mourn for him. I'm gonna say as one mourns for an only son

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.760
 and they will weep bitterly over him like the bitter weeping of a firstborn.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.159
 I mean I'm gonna say New Testament but it's probably Old Testament. Yeah that's

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.239
 right. Can I ask you why did you think that the

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:53.639
 parts sounded like New Testament? Oh it sounded like he was getting pierced to the cross or something.

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:58.879
 And this is 700 years before Jesus is born. Who is he talking about? Last one.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:03.839
 For I'm not ashamed of the gospel. To everyone who believes to the Jew

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:10.439
 first and also to the Greek. I mean I'm gonna say the new again but is it the old?

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.200
 This is the New Testament. Oh this is the new. I don't think they were talking too much

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.840
 about Greeks in the Old Testament. Yes. You got it. You got it. The New Testament.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.400
 You're right. Bro we got four for four. Four for four. You win. You win the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.879
 Brit HaChadasha. You initially thought it was from the Tanakh and why? You know we are

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.840
 the chosen ones by God. Yes. And something about talking about the non-Jews

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.319
 is more modern. That's a great point. Did you know that that God told Abraham

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.840
 that from him, from his seed, will become a great blessing to all the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.560
 nations? Wow. I didn't know that. Yeah so this is why we're here because we want

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.840
 people to understand that the Tanakh gives a promise and the New Testament

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.440
 fulfills that promise in Yeshua. Like Yeshua he's the only person that can fit

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.400
 the description of the Mashiach. Only person. And so we're trying to teach

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.200
 people that, Regha, open the eyes and look for yourselves. Read some of the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.120
 Tanakh. Read the New Testament. You can see for yourself what it's talking about

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.800
 because we feel that our life is on the line here. And so if people aren't

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.840
 thinking about how they can secure their future with God and their last day comes

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.640
 it's scary. So we just want to share with people where they can find eternal

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.040
 salvation and forgiveness. Yeah so if you're interested we have a New

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.560
 Testament in Hebrew we can give to you for you to read. Really? Yeah. Why not? Okay.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.520
 I'd love to. Cool. Let me get it for you. You might want to actually start in the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.080
 in the Tanakh on the last book. Malachi. And go right into here. All right. And

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.280
 you'll see a narrative that takes you from here to there. It's very smooth. It's

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.120
 a smooth transition. It's wonderful. And read this because this is for our

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.000
 Jewish people. If you open it up and you read the first verse, open it up,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Read the first verse of the New Testament.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.680
 Okay. So does this sound like something foreign to our Jewish people? Does that

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.400
 sound like something Zahar? Not at all. Something foreign? Something from the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.000
 Christians? It's theirs. It's not ours? No. It sounds mine. It sounds very Jewish. Right. And all you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.600
 needed to do is look at the very first sentence to find out. Yeah. So look

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.120
 through that and you can contact us if you want to if you have any questions.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.080
 Amazing. All right. Thank you very much. You are amazing. Thank you. I think you need a lot of

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 faith to say that this has nothing to do with Judaism. Yeah and it's important for

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.180
 us to be able to share with our Jewish people the Jewishness of the New

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.400
 Testament and not the fact that it's just Jewish but that it delivers on the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.480
 promises of the Old Testament. Yeah. I loved how people were so surprised to

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.480
 see prophecies that were happening 700 years before Jesus and think that it was

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.080
 written in the New Testament. Right. And we didn't even tell them that it was

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.600
 Jesus. They just said this looks like Jesus. How can this not be Jesus? That

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.120
 needs to be the question. Exactly. Exactly. I hope you guys enjoy this type of video.
