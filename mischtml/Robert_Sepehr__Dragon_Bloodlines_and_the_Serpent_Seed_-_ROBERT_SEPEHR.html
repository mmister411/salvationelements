  <p>I thought I would try to touch on as many video request topics as I could in this video, including the Phoenicians, Aryans, Israelites and Lost Tribes, the Ashkenazi, Noah and his sons, and probably the most frequently requested culture, the Scythians. That seems like quite a lot, but since there's a lot of overlap, I'll give it a shot. So, welcome to another episode.</p>

  <p>The Scythians are the common ancestors of the Indo-European people. The word Indo-European describes a language family spoken over the greater part of Europe and Asia as far as northern India. It implies that a tribe of people, the Proto-Indo-Europeans, have fused in the past from the Black Sea area or Anatolia, and identifying these people ethnically and historically will hopefully tie together many loose ends. Proto just means before, original or first. So Proto-Indo-European means the original tribe of people that spread in antiquity into Europe, to the west, and into India to the east.</p>

  <p>When we look at the branch of anthropology known as linguistics, which means the origin of languages, the oldest branch of Indo-European languages were the Anatolian languages, the geographic area around the Black Sea, including the Caucasus Mountains, which is modern-day Turkey, and Armenia, once part of the Hittite Empire. Pliny the Elder's natural history derives the name of the Caucasus from the Scythian kroikasis, meaning ice shining white with snow. The Caucasus is where we get the term Caucasian from. In a biblical context, it's where Noah was said to have settled after the floodwaters receded.</p>

  <p>In medieval ethnography, the world was divided into three large-scale groupings, corresponding to three classical continents. The Caucasian Semite people of Asia, the Hamidic Caucasian people of North Africa, and the Caucasian Japhetic people of Europe. While these terms are no longer in use, mainly because of changing demographics, keep in mind that they apply to millennia ago and to the nobility of these societies, not every single individual that lived within a geographical region, which at one time included large slave populations.</p>

  <p>For now, let's focus on the expansion of the Scythian culture. The Sumerians lived on the steppes north of the Black Sea until they were driven from their homeland by the Scythians, who had themselves been driven from their homeland in Central Asia by a nomadic Masajeti, who were also part of the group known as Indo-Europeans, meaning their languages shared the same root words and part of the wider Scythian culture. But these ancient Indo-European tribes were not united. They were constantly at war with each other. It doesn't mean that they were not of the same ethnicity, language, group, or race. It just means they fought a lot.</p>

  <p>So there were also cultural variations among these various sects. For example, according to Herodotus, Yet all the wives are held in common, for this is a custom of the Masajeti and not the Scythians. Human life does not come to its natural close with this people. But when a man grows very old, all of his kin's folk collect together and offer him up in sacrifice, offering at the same time some cattle also. After the sacrifice, they boil the flesh and feast on it, and those who thus end their days are reckoned the happiest. If a man dies of disease, they do not eat him and bury him in the ground, bewailing his ill fortune that he did not come to be sacrificed. The only god they worship is the sun, and to him they offer the horse in sacrifice.</p>

  <p>So this Indo-European sect was clearly into sun worship, cannibalism, and sacrifice. Procopius of Caesarea was the principal Byzantine historian of the 6th century, and in his writings called History of the Wars, the Buildings, and the Secret History states that, quote, "the Masajeti, whom they now call Huns." Roman historians also considered the Alans to be the former Masajeti. So I know this might be a little confusing, as these tribes are not spoken about in Hollywood films or even in modern classrooms, but it will make more sense later.</p>

  <p>The 4th century Roman historian Ammianus Marcialis wrote that the Alans were tall, blonde and nearly all of them were men of great stature and beauty. Their hair is somewhat yellow; their eyes are terribly fierce. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the Alans were Scythians. When we look up the Alans, we find that the name Alan is an Iranian dialectical form of Aryan, which brings us to another term no longer used in any university after World War II.</p>

  <p>Yet the word Aryan is etched in stone thousands of years ago in places like the Behistun inscription in Iran and is synonymous with the modern term Indo-European. The Alans, Masajeti, Hittites of Anatolia, Suebi (whom I covered in a recent video), who became the modern Swedes and occupied southern Germany in what is now called Swabia, and the Scythians were all Aryan tribes that shared Indo-European or Aryan ancestry.</p>

  <p>In Histories, Herodotus describes the Boudini of Scythia as red-haired and grey-eyed. In the 5th century BC, Greek physician Hippocrates argued that the Scythians were light-skinned. The 2nd century BC Han Chinese envoy Zhang Qian described the Saka (another name for the ethnicity known as Scythians) as having yellow hair and blue eyes. Pliny the Elder characterizes Saka (Scythians or Tocharians) as red-haired, blue-eyed and unusually tall; which is supported by 4,000-year-old 6'6" tall Caucasian mummies found in China.</p>

  <p>The 4th century bishop Gregory of Nysa wrote that Scythians were fair-skinned and blonde-haired. So these tall ginger and blonde and blue-eyed Aryan tribes from Central Asia and Anatolia (which went by many names including Huns), whose ancient symbology included swastika symbols and serpents entered Europe in several waves; represented as a great dragon in many European myths and legends that had an appetite for cattle and young virgins and in many cases established themselves as royalty and nobility.</p>

  <p>To help drive this point home let us take a look at some of World War I and World War II propaganda from Allied forces about Germans: Hun or Hun is a term used in reference to Huns during migration periods often seen on Allied war posters during World War I & II for example Winston Churchill said "There are less than seventy million malignant Huns some curable others killable already holding down Australians Czechs Poles bullying & pillaging later attacking Soviet Union calling them dull drilled docile brutish masses plodding like swarms locusts.” During this time American President FDR also referred Germans this way saying Allied invasion southern France would assist Eisenhower driving Huns from France.</p>

  <p>My point simply being blue-eyed Middle Easterners migrated Europe many ancestors today clueless about Central Asian/Middle Eastern origins thinking fair-haired Europeans sprouted ground similarly people India think upper caste Aryans always there never riding horses introducing Sanskrit swastika ethnic caste system thousands years ago when certainly did geneticists compared mitochondrial DNA blue-eyed individuals diverse countries like Jordan Denmark Turkey concluded people blue eyes single ancestor by Black Sea around 8000 years ago spreading out during Holocene along domesticated animals agriculture civilization Aryan language family including many non-blue eyed but recessively carrying blue eye gene Live Science published article Blue-Eyed Immigrants Transformed Ancient Israel 6500 Years Ago stating waves migrants north east today Iran Turkey transformed region introducing new genes cultural practices including blue-eyed fossils caves matching Anatolia/Gagroas Mountains finding washing domstistis/zagros mountains fossils matching Anatolia pre-noah's ark preserving domestic animals BlueGreenEyePheno types matching phenotypes rediscover mummies pharaohs tombs without discrepancies retelling myths legends intertwining histories factual record interpret biblical accounts scientific genetic sequences fossilized remains</p>

    <p>Plow, a yoke, a cup, and a battle axe. Only the youngest son succeeded in touching the golden implements without them bursting with fire. And this son's descendants, called by Herodotus the royal Scythians, continued to guard them. In another legend, as told by Herodotus, all Scythians were direct descendants of Hercules, who had three sons from a mythical beast whose lower part was snake-like and whose upper part was one of a hermaphrodite.</p>
    <p>The word hermaphrodite is a combination of the words Hermes and Aphrodite and has occult interpretations that I've covered in previous videos. The lower serpentine body is similar to the legend of Melusine, which is the goddess used by Starbucks on their logo, which I also covered in a prior episode and will leave a link to in the description.</p>
    <p>In 2017, another genetic study of the Scythians suggested that the Scythians were related to the Yama culture, also known as the ochre grave culture, dating to the Bronze Age around 3300 BC, which derives from its characteristic burial tradition with red ochre. The pits were called Yama. So, as you can see, this area is bordering the north of the Caucasus Mountains, where Mount Ararat is located, and where we find the story of Noah and his three sons, which of course is part of the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament.</p>
    <p>It's interesting that, according to Herodotus, the Scythians did not eat pork and banned all swine from their territory. That said, let's look at some other names that are attributed to the Scythians. The Encyclopedia Britannica states the term Saka and Scyths were regarded as synonymous. Herodotus wrote that the Persians call all the Scythians Sakai.</p>
    <p>There are historians that say that the Scythians belonged to the ten lost tribes of Israel and were allied to what we call the Phoenician Empire, linking the Scythian tribes to the Hebrew patriarch Isaac. According to the Bible, Isaac was the son of Abraham, who was, along with his wife Sarah, the first Israelite to enter the land of Egypt. I can't go into detail regarding the lost tribes now, as that will require several videos to properly cover.</p>
    <p>But I will say that, archaeologically speaking, there is an ancient city in modern Israel, just north of Jerusalem, that was once called Scythopolis, as you can see here on this map. Which brings us to another name the Scythians were known as, the Askuzai. In Hebrew, the word Ashkenazi means Germans, particularly communities along the Rhine River in western Germany and in northern France, dating to the Middle Ages. Their language is Yiddish, which is a form of High German.</p>
    <p>Swabian is another Aryan language considered High German, which is where New Swabia, or Neu Schwabenland in Antarctica, is named after. In the 19th century, the German theologian August Wilhelm Nobel equated Ashkenaz with the Germans, deriving the name of the Assyr from Ashkenaz. The Assyr are the gods of the principal pantheon in Norse religion, including Odin and Thor.</p>
    <p>The name Ashkenazi derives from the biblical figure of Ashkenaz, who was the first son of Gomer, son of Japheth, and Japheth was one of the three sons of Noah. Japheth's tribe is considered to be the progenitor of European and, later, East Asian peoples, in other words, Indo-European or Aryans. Japheth is also equated with the Greek titan Ipitos, mentioned by Homer, the ancestor of the Hellenic people.</p>
    <p>Named after Helen of Troy, whose bloodline was considered sacred, which I recently covered in a video about Mary and skull symbology. In the 7th century, Isidore of Seville, who is often regarded as the last scholar of the ancient world, published his noted history in which he traces the origins of most of the nations of Europe back to Japheth. In Scotland, histories tracing the Scottish people to Japheth were also widely published.</p>
    <p>I have another video linked in the description about how Scotland got its name. Princess Scotta, ancestor of the Gaels, was also known as Meritaten, a daughter of King Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti, and sister of King Tut. They were all part of the Hyksos dynasty of Egypt. In Egyptian, Hyksos means foreign rulers, and they introduced the horse, chariot, and bronze medal to the African continent, as well as Aten worship.</p>
    <p>Aten worship is considered the first form of monotheism, meaning the belief in one God, which in this case is symbolized by the Sun. Josephus calls them the shepherd kings, and anthropologically speaking, they entered Egypt via the Middle East, starting from Anatolia. So now things should start falling into place as the Scythians were blonde and red-haired and had blue eyes.</p>
    <p>Just like many Egyptian statues and a phenotype common in Scotland and Ireland. The Ashkenazi Jews also predominantly have fair hair and light eyes. In Islamic tradition, 36 languages of the world could be traced back to Japheth, and he's usually regarded as the ancestor of the Gog and Magog tribes and at times of Turks, Khazars, Illyrians, Dacians.</p>
    <p>And Eastern Europeans around Ukraine. That said, many of the last Scythians were absorbed into what today are called Slavic people who are also fair-haired with light eyes. The Polish can also claim descent from the ancient Iranian Sarmatians, part of the wider Scythian cultures making up the dominant Baroque culture and ideology of nobility that existed in Renaissance to 18th centuries.</p>
    <p>That also extended into Ukraine and Russia. Which is why Russian money from pre-communist times boldly bears Aryan symbology prominently in middle of currency. As I have stated several times before: Prophet Muhammad himself had red hair bringing us to Khazars.</p>
    <p>When one looks at map of Indo-European or Aryan expansions comparing it to Khazarian Empire area similarities speak for itself. Geographic area attributes to Ashkenazis ethnically one same. I'll include link in description to prior video I did about Templars German sect settling Haifa century before Israel independence largely populated by Germanic Ashkenazi people arriving on nationalist socialist ships 1933-1939 secret agreement historically factual even if no longer publicized.</p>

    <p>It looks like it might rain today, so I'm just going to feed my friends here and cut this intro short. Today's episode will be a continuation on the theme about the Scythians, their ancient origins, and the influence of their lineage on history, which continues until this day.</p>
    
    <p>The Merovingian dynasty was the ruling family of the Franks from the middle of the 5th century until 751, their royal bloodline emerging as the King of the Franks, a group of Germanic people whose name was first mentioned in 3rd century Roman sources, but along with other Germanic tribes that I mentioned in my last video, stemmed from Scythians or Aryans that penetrated into Europe from Anatolia. If you haven't seen it yet, I'll leave a link in the description. It's called History of the Royal Dragon Bloodline, and their ancient symbol was the dragon, which comes down to us in legends of invading dragons in European mythology.</p>
    
    <p>When we look up the etymology of the word dragon, we find that it says, from Old French dragon and directly from Latin draconum or draco, meaning huge serpent, and from Greek dracon, meaning serpent, giant, sea fish, but then it also says it stems from Dirkish tai, to see clearly, and from Proto-Indo-European dirk, to see. In Sanskrit, visible. In Old Irish, I have seen. Old English and Old High German, light, clear. And Albanian, which linguistically is very close to the original Proto-Indo-European, and means light. Then it goes on to say, perhaps in the literal sense, it's the one with the deadly glance. That's interesting, and conjures up the ancient symbol that is most commonly referred to as the evil eye, which is famous all over the Mediterranean since ancient times, spanning much of what has once been the Phoenician Empire, colonies, and trade routes.</p>
    
    <p>In Hebrew, dragon translates to tanin, a great sea monster, which brings us back to the Merovingians, whose name is said to derive from Merovi, king of the Franks. According to the legend, Merovi had two fathers, King Clodion and a strange beast of the sea. The druidic title of Pendragon, which means high dragon, or king of kings, was passed on to the Merovingian kings in 666 AD. In Bloodline of the Holy Grail, Lawrence Gardner says, quote, Despite the carefully listed genealogies of his time, the heritage of Merovius was strangely obscured in the monastic annals. Although the rightful son of Clodion, he was nonetheless said by historians, Priscus, to have been sired by an arcane sea creature, the Bisti Neptunus.</p>
    
    <p>The Cimbrian Franks, from whose female line the Merovingians emerged, were associated with the Grecian Arcadia before migrating to the Rhineland. As we have seen, they call themselves the Numaj, people of the New Covenant, just as the scenes of Qumran had once been known. It was the Arcadian legacy that was responsible for the mysterious sea beast, the Bisti Neptunus, as symbolically defined in the Merovingian ancestry. The relevant sea lord was King Pallas, a god of old Arcadia. The immortal sea lord was said to be ever-incarnate in the dynasty of ancient kings, whose symbol was a fish, as was the traditional symbol of Jesus.</p>
   
    <p>This sea creature represents Neptune, the god of the sea in mythology, who was said to have founded Atlantis, which is the pagan version of the pre-Flood civilization which God judged in Genesis. It describes the intermarriage of mankind with the sons of gods: "And it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose. And the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years." There were giants in those days and also after that when the sons of God came into the daughters of men and they bore children to them: "the same became mighty men of old men of renown." It implies that the serpent seed continues after the deluge through Noah's Caucasian descendants with the serpent being perceived in different ways depending on civilization as even Jesus is said to have referred to serpents as wise.</p>
    
    <p>The legend of King Merovi seems to conceal the true origins of the Merovingian race in remote antiquity. Merovius derives from French words mer meaning sea and ver meaning werewolf or dragon. The book of Revelation informs us that dragon is devil and Satan yet Hebrew word Satan means an adversary or one who resists. So again it should be considered from whose perspective is story being told helps explain esoteric illusion Merovingian’s progenitor King Merovi king France sired by mysterious beast sea claim dynasty literally Satanic descent.</p>
    
    <p>In book Holy Blood Holy Grail authors quote dozen families Britain Europe today numerous collateral branches Merovingian lineage include House Habsburg Lorraine Planter Luxembourg Montague various others pre-war documents Sinclair family Britain allied bloodline branches Stuarts many documents Scion asserts new king accordance tradition would rule but not govern priest-king functions primarily ritual symbolic capacity actual business governing handled conceivably Priory de Scion.</p>

    <p>There's a dragon on the flag of Bhutan, a Buddhist kingdom on the Himalayas' eastern edge bordered by Tibet and known for its monasteries, fortresses, and visits by the Anunnabi in the 1930s, the ancestral heritage anthropology branch of the German Nationalists, who conducted research into ancient Aryan archaeology around the world, finding archaeological evidence in places like Tibet, as well as the mummies of the Canary Islands, and ultimately linking them to a forgotten global civilization of Atlantis during the Pleistocene or Ice Age, which settled in Anatolia after a major deluge and re-established civilization there, spreading out again to other parts of the world as their nobility.</p>

    <p>That said, it is these Aryan tribes that went by many names, including Scythians, that migrated into Europe in several waves, becoming the Druids, and intermarrying with the royal families and becoming sovereigns, the royal dragon bloodline. The House of Dracul, or Dracula, which means dragon, and that Prince Charles claims direct lineage, descended from Attila the Hun and was established in central Europe by the sons of Genghis Khan. So the Druid kings were descended from Scythian royalty and later became the Merovingian dynasty, which eventually converted to Christianity.</p>

    <p>Even after their conversion to Christianity, the Merovingian rulers, like the patriarchs of the Old Testament, were polygamous, particularly with their own bloodline. This ancient use of polygamy in a royal family and occult sex magic is very ancient, as the Scythian line also stretches back into ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia, as this same bloodline was not only that of the pharaohs but also the Anunnaki, which means those of royal blood, or the serpent seed, or princely noble seed.</p>

    <p>Which brings us to Robert de Bruce, who was far more than an early Scottish king but was high-born Merovingian, priest-king of the Celtic Church, liberator of Scotland from England, sovereign grandmaster of the Order of the Knights Templar, and founder of the Order of the Rosy Cross. According to Prince Michael Stewart, author of The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland, in 1307, under the auspices of Robert de Bruce and the excommunicated clergy, the Order was restructured into a church, with a hierarchy quite independent of Rome.</p>

    <p>The Templar church had abbots, priests, and even bishops. The knights began to train the army of Robert de Bruce in the hit-and-run tactics of warfare established in the Crusades. The Roman church may have betrayed the Templars, but in Scotland they found something far more trustworthy and tangible, a sacred royal house and a priest-king of the Celtic Church succession. The King of Scots was installed as a hereditary sovereign grandmaster, and from that time, whichever descending king held that office, he was to be known as Saint Germain.</p>

    <p>A new order was then formed, called the Elder Brothers of the Rosy Cross, and several of the Rosy Cross knights then sailed to France for a meeting with Pope John XXII at Avignon. Many historians have presumed, therefore, that the Knights Templar must have disbanded in Scotland, but this was not the case. It was simply that Bruce had contrived the secret order to become even more secretive. Indeed, the Order of the Knights of the Rosy Cross had been established by Bruce for Templars who had been valiant at Bannockburn, and this was a very successful cover.</p>

    <p>The Merovingian dynasty still maintains its legitimacy, and according to members of the organization, will one day openly assert the divine right of the nobility to rule the world as an angelic race of demigods, whose ancestors, they claim, were the fallen angels.

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Hun was a term used as a reference to the Huns of the migration period and used during WWI and WWII to describe Germans.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Geneticists concluded that people with blue eyes have a single common ancestor that lived by the Black Sea around 8,000 years ago.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Blue-eyed immigrants transformed ancient Israel 6,500 years ago.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Archaeologists discovered this historic population shift by analyzing DNA from skeletons preserved in an Israeli cave.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">DNA analysis showed that the skeletons preserved in the cave were genetically distinct from people who historically lived in that region.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Genetic differences matched those of people who lived in neighboring Anatolia and the Zagros Mountains.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There is no discrepancy between myths and legends of tall blue-eyed Aryans and genetic or fossil records.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Anthropological data shows the Scythians were tall and powerfully built.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Scythian warrior and noblemen were often more than six feet tall.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Ordinary people dominated by the Scythians were much smaller in stature.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Skeletons of Scythian nobles differ from those of today by their longer arm and leg bones, and stronger bone formation.</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">All Scythians were direct descendants of Hercules, who had three sons from a mythical beast whose lower part was snake-like and whose upper part was one of a hermaphrodite.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The word hermaphrodite is a combination of the words Hermes and Aphrodite.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The lower serpentine body is similar to the legend of Melusine.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The goddess Melusine is used by Starbucks on their logo.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">In 2017, another genetic study of the Scythians suggested that the Scythians were related to the Yama culture, also known as the ochre grave culture, dating to the Bronze Age around 3300 BC.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Yama culture derives from its characteristic burial tradition with red ochre.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The area mentioned is bordering the north of the Caucasus Mountains, where Mount Ararat is located and where we find the story of Noah and his three sons.</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Some historians say that the Scythians belonged to the ten lost tribes of Israel and were allied to what we call the Phoenician Empire, linking the Scythian tribes to the Hebrew patriarch Isaac.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">According to the Bible, Isaac was the son of Abraham, who was the first Israelite to enter the land of Egypt along with his wife Sarah.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Archaeologically speaking, there is an ancient city in modern Israel, just north of Jerusalem, that was once called Scythopolis.</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Swabian is another Aryan language considered High German.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The German theologian August Wilhelm Nobel equated Ashkenaz with the Germans, deriving the name of the Assyr from Ashkenaz.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Assyr are the gods of the principal pantheon in Norse religion, including Odin and Thor.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The name Ashkenazi derives from the biblical figure of Ashkenaz, who was the first son of Gomer, son of Japheth.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Japheth was one of the three sons of Noah.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Japheth's tribe is considered to be the progenitor of European and, later, East Asian peoples, in other words, Indo-European or Aryans.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Japheth is also equated with the Greek titan Ipitos, mentioned by Homer, the ancestor of the Hellenic people.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Isidore of Seville published a noted history in the 7th century in which he traces the origins of most of the nations of Europe back to Japheth.</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Today’s episode will be a continuation on the theme about the Scythians, their ancient origins, and the influence of their lineage on history.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Merovingian dynasty was the ruling family of the Franks from the middle of the 5th century until 751.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Merovingian’s royal bloodline emerged as the King of the Franks, a group of Germanic people whose name was first mentioned in 3rd century Roman sources.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Germanic tribes stemmed from Scythians or Aryans that penetrated into Europe from Anatolia.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The history of the Royal Dragon Bloodline, and their ancient symbol was the dragon.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The word dragon is derived from Old French dragon and directly from Latin draconum or draco, meaning huge serpent.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Greek word dracon means serpent, giant, sea fish, but also stems from Dirkish tai, meaning to see clearly, and from Proto-Indo-European dirk, meaning to see.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">In Sanskrit, the word for dragon translates to visible.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">In Old Irish, the word for dragon means I have seen.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">In Albanian, which is closely related to Proto-Indo-European, the word dragon means light.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">In Hebrew, dragon translates to tanin, a great sea monster.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Merovi, the name of the Merovingians, is said to derive from Merovi, king of the Franks.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">According to legend, Merovi had two fathers, King Clodion and a strange beast of the sea.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The druidic title of Pendragon, which means high dragon or king of kings, was passed on to the Merovingian kings in 666 AD.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The heritage of Merovius was strangely obscured in the monastic annals.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Merovius was the rightful son of Clodion, but historians like Priscus said he was sired by an arcane sea creature, the Bisti Neptunus.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Cimbrian Franks, from whose female line the Merovingians emerged, were associated with the Grecian Arcadia before migrating to the Rhineland.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Cimbrian Franks called themselves the Numaj, people of the New Covenant.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The sea beast, the Bisti Neptunus, is symbolically defined in the Merovingian ancestry.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The sea lord King Pallas was a god of old Arcadia.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The immortal sea lord was said to be ever-incarnate in the dynasty of ancient kings, whose symbol was a fish, which was also the traditional symbol of Jesus.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">This sea creature represents Neptune, the god of the sea in mythology, who was said to have founded Atlantis.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The pagan version of the pre-Flood civilization describes the intermarriage of mankind with the sons of gods.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The King Merovi seems to conceal the true origins of the Merovingian race in remote antiquity.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Merovius derives from the French words mer meaning sea and ver meaning werewolf or dragon.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The book of Revelation informs that the dragon is the devil and Satan.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Hebrew word Satan means an adversary or one who resists.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Some legends claim the Merovingian dynasty is of literally Satanic descent.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail tell us there are at least a dozen families in Britain and Europe today with numerous collateral branches who are of Merovingian lineage.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Sinclair family in Britain is allied to the Merovingian bloodline, as are various branches of the Stuarts.</li>

<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court conspired to regain control of the Holy Roman Empire through infiltration of church and state.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The insignia of the Imperial and Royal Dragon Court was a dragon in the form of a circle and a red cross.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">King Sigismund of Luxembourg reconstituted the Imperial and Royal Dragon Court in 1408.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Societis Draconis was based upon the ancient bloodline tradition inherited from presumed Egyptian and Scythian ancestors through the royal house of Vir of Anjou.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The lineage descended on one side through the Tuatha de Danann, or the Dragon Kings of Anu.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Dragon Kings of Anu are a race of people that settled Ireland from around 800 BC.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">This lineage also includes the Black Sea Scythian princes from around modern Ukraine.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Egyptian Dragon Dynasty of Sobek is known from the Old Kingdom through the Roman period.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">This Egyptian lineage included the bloodline of the Davidic House of Judah, who married into the Merovingian Kings of the Franks.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">There was a very great Jewish component among the Cicumbrian Franks and Merovingians.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The aristocratic Merovingian children married into almost all of the noble families of Europe during the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The foundation of European nobility is claimed by some historians to be Jewish.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">Members of the Dragon Court would often wear the insignia of a dragon curved into a circle with a red cross.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The insignia of the dragon identifies the Grail's succession from before 3000 BC.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The House of Vere is descended in numerous lines from the Merovingian dynasty.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The German word for dragon simply means one who sees clearly.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The serpentine quality is associated with healing and the spinal column and cerebral cortex.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Protestant Church and some groups consider the serpent seed theory to trace back to pre-Flood civilizations.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The symbols of serpents or dragons are found in many cultures around the world.</li>
<li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light ">The Principality of Wales features a red dragon on its flag.</li>
