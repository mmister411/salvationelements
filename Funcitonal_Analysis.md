The Functional Template is a structured tool for analyzing any spiritual, ethical, or doctrinal element by mapping its mechanics, triggers, evidence, boundaries, and outcomes. It is not a conceptual overview or doctrinal summary. It is a logic-based, scripture-reference-backed diagnostic form designed to describe what a thing does, how it works, and under what conditions it functions.

Below is a description of the template, followed by what is entailed in filling it out.

Functional/Mechanical/Concretely Descriptive Item Title

The item under review must be named according to what it does or how it operates, not by its theological label. This forces clarity and avoids conceptual fog.

Subsections

A.K.A. / Associated With / What is Meant By

List alternative terms used in scripture, theology, or tradition to refer to this same function. This section establishes cross-reference awareness while focusing the lens on what these labels actually point to in operation.

Source or Cause of Event, Operation, or Methodology

Define how the function is initiated or sustained. This may include divine agency, spiritual law, human action, covenantal conditions, or situational triggers.

Requirement for or Confirmation of Event Taking Place
	•	Affirmation:
List the positive evidences that the function is genuinely present or has occurred. These should be scripturally traceable and observable in principle.
	•	Negation:
Identify what excludes the function—conditions that contradict, nullify, or disqualify its presence or activation.

Accounts For

Describe what the function solves, explains, or produces. This section captures its effects, benefits, or logical outputs. It connects purpose to performance.

Considerations
	•	Exemptions:
Specify who or what is not subject to this function due to scriptural precedent, moral capacity, or other qualifying boundaries.
	•	Limitations:
Define what the function does not do or where it fails to operate fully. Identify known weak points, incomplete applications, or time-bound constraints.
	•	Inferences:
Include necessary or likely deductions from scriptural patterns. This allows derived logic without speculative abstraction.
	•	Alerts:
Identify common dangers, distortions, or spiritual vulnerabilities associated with misapplying, faking, or misrepresenting the function.

Pathing Description Where Applicable
	•	One-Up: [Functional/Mechanical Output or Transition]
State the next possible enabled state, behavior, or spiritual mechanism that becomes available or demanded once the current function is in place.
	•	Triggers:
Describe the conditions that allow this next possibility to activate.
	•	Variation (whether by Space or Time, enumerable):
Outline how the function or its outcomes change across periods, covenants, individuals, or settings.
	•	Option Type:
Specify form variants (e.g., prophetic office vs. gift, pre-Christ vs. post-Christ implementation).
	•	Entry:
Detail what allows someone or something to enter into this function or role in that variation.

Filling It Out: What It Entails

1. Discipline in Functional Naming

Avoid inherited or symbolic names. Every title should be a mechanical description of what the item is doing in practice. This forces the analyst to define action, not just concept.

2. Traceability to Scripture

Each claim, trigger, or outcome should be grounded in direct text, consistent pattern, or inferable biblical logic. The analyst must gather and group scriptural data with precision.

3. Condition-Oriented Thinking

The analyst must shift from doctrinal assertion to conditional logic:
	•	What causes this?
	•	What prevents this?
	•	What proves this?
	•	What comes from this?

Each line filled out should answer one of these four.

4. Distinguishing Necessary from Possible

Not everything listed is essential for salvation, righteousness, or covenant status. The schema must distinguish between what is necessary, what is confirmatory, and what is corollary.

5. Awareness of Edge Cases

The analyst must include:
	•	Persons exempt (e.g., infants, impaired)
	•	Cases where a function occurs but doesn’t advance
	•	Warnings where something that looks like the function is a counterfeit

This preserves the integrity of the diagnostic while respecting the nuance of real-world variation.

6. Mapping Possibility, Not Sequence

The pathing section is not historical or theological narrative. It defines what becomes possible as a result of the current state. It is a map of semantic and spiritual affordances.
