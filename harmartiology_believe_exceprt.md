Sin originates in the willful turning away of creatures from God, his truth or design for Creation in thought, communication, action or affiliation. Rather than being its own independent existence, sin is corrupted creature agency metastasized through the self and into the environment. While sin is a corrupting force progressing to deceive and dominate the given person, sin is also a word referring to choices, actions, thoughts, or communications that violate good, law, or faith known to the person. Additionally, sin refers to the fallen propensity for persons to defer to self-serving, short-sighted, beastlike nature inherited from Adam rather than what is good through justice, service or sacrifice.  This is not to say that human nature is evil but that undistorted human nature is what was lost in the fall and can only be imitated by chance apart from the Grace of God.

The corruptive effects of sin on the biosphere, causal effects on history, or judicial ramifications upon a group membership can be inherited.  The guilt, indebtedness, or individual liability of sin cannot be inherited. Adam’s sin doomed the flesh of all his descendants to corruption of the physical livelihood of material bodies and natural dispositions of their souls. Through Adam, every instance of Adamic life will naturally end it's time on Earth at least once. However, the breath of God, which gives life to all, is not of Adam’s seed but is the light that enlightens every person conceived in the world.  Personal sin severs the functional connection between the human soul and its original spirit breathed out by God, rendering the person dead in trespasses and sins to default spiritual functionality. (Genesis 2:7; Genesis 3:16–19; Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 5:9; Deuteronomy 24:16; Job 33:4; Ecclesiastes 12:7; Isaiah 59:2; Daniel 9:16; Hosea 4:1–3; Lamentations 5:7; John 1:9; Romans 5:12–14; Romans 7:18, 23; Romans 8:6–8; Romans 8:20–22; 1 Corinthians 2:14; 1 Corinthians 15:21–22; Ephesians 2:1–5; Ephesians 2:3; Colossians 2:13; Hebrews 9:27; James 1:14–15; Ezekiel 18:20)

The remedy for the death of the soul-spirit connection is the impartation of a new spirit by the Father’s breath, creating a renewed human spirit. This being born-again is a prerequesite for and separate from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. This spiritual rebirth accounts for regaining functionality innate to the human spirit, such as communion with God, but does nothing for the soulical corruption caused by sin or the eternal debt incurred from sinning (Rom 7:23–24; Matt 6:12). The payout of the debt of personal sin is dimensional exile to a place fit to suffer the eternal judicial sentencing attached to that sin or many sins.  The debt can only by blood or life.  This functionality is called atonement.  The Soul that sins cannot atone for itself by itself. The central tenet of the gospel is that the blood of Jesus and His death on the Cross and his resurrecting to life are the atoning work that will cover all whose names are found in the Lamb's book of Life at the final Judgement.
