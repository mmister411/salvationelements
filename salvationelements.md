The Seven Elements of Salvation
=======================================================

### Introduction:

This document aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the elements of salvation according to scripture, breaking them down into functional terms that are easy to grasp. Salvation is not a one-time event but a journey, nor a monolithic force but a process that involves various aspects of spiritual transformation and growth. This guide is structured around seven key layers, each representing a significant aspect of the salvation dynamic. Each section will delve into the theological terms associated with these layers, the scriptural basis for each, and the practical implications for a believer's life. Whether you are new to the Christian faith or seeking a deeper understanding of your spiritual journey, this guide aims to be a valuable resource for you.

#### Hermeneutical Disclaimer:

This analysis proceeds on the methodological assumption that theology must arise traceably from exegesis of the text.  All readings and conclusions must respect immediate literary and historical context, while additionally being apt to consider wider material from the given book and canon as applicable. Systematic theology, interpretive tradition, naming conventions, science, archaeology, and philosophy possess intrinsic value as disciplines.  Use of these disciplines must not override textual content that is explicitly stated or cogently inferable or import semiotic artifacts untenably foreign to its original information environment. Interpretive lenses are necessarily embedded in any interpretive operation of scripture but must not weigh in at the expense of the text’s self defined logos, ethos or pathos.

      - Infants, Children, cognitively impaired, or others unable to commit personal sin, as their original spirits are not altered by personal sin (Matthew 18:3, 2 Samuel 12:23, Deuteronomy 1:39).
    - Limitations: 
      - New Birth is an absolute requirement but does not ensure entry into the Kingdom of God. (Matthew 13:3-23, Matthew 25:1-13, Hebrews 3:14)
      - New Birth is necessary function of new covenant but exists before it as a requirement for kingdom entry across redemptive history. (Deuteronomy 10:16, 30:6; Psalm 51:10, Ezek 11:19–20)
    - Inferences: 
      - All labled or refered to as righteous, upright, qodeshim, or the congregation from the old testament were born-again, lest these not see the kingdom of God (Hebrews 11, Psalm 1:5; Habakkuk 2:4)

      - While the blood of Jesus covers all sin, Judicial Pardon does not address other spiritual conditions rendering one unable to enter the Strait Gate (Matthew 13:3-23, Matthew 18:21-35, Matthew 25:14-30, Heb 12:14).
    - Inferences:
      - [1] The Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world; [2] He is the only God formed; [3] He has mercy on whom He wills; Therefore the force behind all sacrifices, faith and repentance has always been the blood of the lamb. (Revelation 13:8; Hebrews 9:12-15; Romans 3:25; 1 Peter 1:19-20)
      - [1] The Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. (Revelation 13:8, Habakkuk 3:4); [2] He is the only God formed. (Isaiah 43:10–11); [3] He has mercy on whom He wills. (Romans 9:15); Therefore, the force behind all sacrifices, faith, and repentance has always been the blood of the Lamb. (Hebrews 9:12–15; Romans 3:25)
    - Alert:
      - Unforgiveness in all forms threatens to render the soul incompatible with Judicial Pardon of personal sins. (Matthew 6:14–15; Matthew 18:21–35; Hebrews 12:15; 1 Peter 4:8)

    - Alert:  
      - Soulical Cleanliness is sensitive to holy Fear of the Lord (Proverbs 8:13, Proverbs 16:6) and not grieving or quenching the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:19)
      - Soulical contamination is relative to each person with some dangers being universal such as but not limited to unforgiveness, drinking blood or mixing Jesus with other spirituality, especially occultism or mystery religion (Acts 15:20, 29; 21:25; 1 Corinthians 10:20-21; 2 Corinthians 6:14-17; Deuteronomy 18:9-12).

  - **Results:**
    - **Glorification**: transformation and immortality (Rom 8:30; 1 Cor 15:49–54).
    - **Lake of Fire**: eternal separation for the condemned (Rev 20:14–15).
