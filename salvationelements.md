The Seven Elements of Salvation
=======================================================

### Introduction:

This document aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the elements of salvation according to scripture, breaking them down into functional terms that are easy to grasp. Salvation is not a one-time event but a journey, nor a monolithic force but a process that involves various aspects of spiritual transformation and growth. This guide is structured around seven key layers, each representing a significant aspect of the salvation dynamic. Each section will delve into the theological terms associated with these layers, the scriptural basis for each, and the practical implications for a believer's life. Whether you are new to the Christian faith or seeking a deeper understanding of your spiritual journey, this guide aims to be a valuable resource for you.

#### Hermeneutical Disclaimer:

This analysis proceeds on the methodological assumption that theology must arise traceably from exegesis of the text.  All readings and conclusions must respect immediate literary and historical context, while additionally being apt to consider wider material from the given book and canon as applicable. Systematic theology, interpretive tradition, naming conventions, science, archaeology, and philosophy possess intrinsic value as disciplines.  Use of these disciplines must not override textual content that is explicitly stated or cogently inferable or import semiotic artifacts untenably foreign to its original information environment. Interpretive lenses are necessarily embedded in any interpretive operation of scripture but must not weigh in at the expense of the text’s self defined logos, ethos or pathos.

      - Infants, Children, cognitively impaired, or others unable to commit personal sin, as their original spirits are not altered by personal sin (Matthew 18:3, 2 Samuel 12:23, Deuteronomy 1:39).
    - Limitations: 
      - New Birth is an absolute requirement but does not ensure entry into the Kingdom of God. (Matthew 13:3-23, Matthew 25:1-13, Hebrews 3:14)
      - New Birth is necessary function of new covenant but exists before it as a requirement for kingdom entry across redemptive history. (Deuteronomy 10:16, 30:6; Psalm 51:10, Ezek 11:19–20)
    - Inferences: 
      - All labled or refered to as righteous, upright, qodeshim, or the congregation from the old testament were born-again, lest these not see the kingdom of God (Hebrews 11, Psalm 1:5; Habakkuk 2:4)
    - Alert:
      - There will be many who experienced the new birth but are cast into perdition for loving darkness despite the measure of light they've known. (John 3:19, Romans 2:13-15, Matthew 7:21–23, John 15:2, 6; 2 Peter 2:20–22)
- Judicial Pardon

      - Infants, cognitively impaired, or others unable to commit personal sin are exempt due to their personal innocence in the context of justice (Matthew 19:14, Luke 18:16, James 4:17, Romans 4:15).
    - Limitations:  
      - While the blood of Jesus covers all sin, Judicial Pardon does not address other spiritual conditions rendering one unable to enter the Strait Gate (Matthew 13:3-23, Matthew 18:21-35, Matthew 25:14-30, Heb 12:14).
    - Inferences:
      - [1] The Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world; [2] He is the only God formed; [3] He has mercy on whom He wills; Therefore the force behind all sacrifices, faith and repentance has always been the blood of the lamb. (Revelation 13:8; Hebrews 9:12-15; Romans 3:25; 1 Peter 1:19-20)
    - Alert:
      - Unforgiveness in all forms threatens to render the soul incompatible with Judicial Pardon of personal sins. (Matthew 6:14–15; Matthew 18:21–35; Hebrews 12:15; 1 Peter 4:8)

    - Affirmation
      - Blood of Jesus (1 John 1:7; Revelation 1:5; Hebrews 9:14; Hebrews 10:22; 1 Peter 1:18–19; Isaiah 1:18)
      - Advocacy (Hebrews 7:25; Philippians 4:6; James 5:16; Galatians 6:2; Isaiah 53:4; Matthew 25:40; Proverbs 31:8–9; 1 Thessalonians 5:14; Romans 12:15)
      - Watering (Ephesians 5:26, John 7:37–39, Philippians 4:6, Hebrews 10:24–25, 1 Corinthians 10:16, Psalm 1:2–3).
    - Negation
      - Remaining Unspotted from the World (James 1:27; 1 John 2:15–17; Romans 12:2; 2 Peter 1:4; 2 Corinthians 6:17; 2 Timothy 2:21; Titus 2:11–12)

    - Holiness required to See the LORD (Hebrews 12:14, 1 Peter 1:15-16)
    - Ability to Enter in at the Strait Gate of the City with Foundations (Matthew 7:13-14, Luke 13:24)
  - Considerations:
    - Exemptions:  
      - None due to the inherent uncleaness of all souls by way of the first Adam (Romans 5:12; Psalm 51:5)
    - Limitation:  
      - Initial and repeat decontamination are given freely by grace but loving darkness is resisting the gift, allowing for recontamination (John 3:19–20)
      - Decontamination is impermanent like the oil of a burning lamp and needs to be tended (Matthew 25:1–13)
    - Alert:  
      - Soulical Cleanliness is sensitive to holy Fear of the Lord (Proverbs 8:13, Proverbs 16:6) and not grieving or quenching the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:19)
      - Soulical contamination is relative to each person with some dangers being universal such as but not limited to unforgiveness, drinking blood or mixing Jesus with other spirituality, especially occultism or mystery religion (Acts 15:20, 29; 21:25; 1 Corinthians 10:20-21; 2 Corinthians 6:14-17; Deuteronomy 18:9-12).

    - Sanctifying the Lord in Your Heart ()
  - Source or Cause of Event, Operation, or Methodology:
    - Initiated by exposure to God's self-revelation in word or act (Deuteronomy 4:10; Exodus 20:18–20)
    - Given by the Spirit of the Lord (Isaiah 11:2–3)
    - Cultivated through learning, remembrance, and reflection on God's works and judgments (Psalm 34:11; Deuteronomy 8:6)
    - Deepened by internal recognition of God's holiness, power, and justice (Psalm 119:120; Isaiah 66:2)
    - Strengthened through community alignment and covenantal teaching (Deuteronomy 6:1–2; Acts 9:31)
  - **Evidence of Validity or Confirmation**
  	- **Affirmation:**
      These traits and responses confirm that the Fear of the Lord is present and active:
      - Prioritizing GOD over cares of the world (Matthew 6:33, Luke 10:38-42)
      - Obedience to what you know to be true and good (1 Peter 1:22, James 4:7)
      - Approving what God Loves (Psalm 11:7; Proverbs 15:9; Micah 6:8; 1 John 4:19)
  	  - Disapproval of evil and withdrawal from it (Proverbs 8:13; 16:6)
  	  - Submission & discipline to God’s instructions (Job 28:28; Psalm 111:10)
  	  - Receptive conscience and readiness to repent (Isaiah 66:2; Proverbs 28:14)
  	  - A lifestyle marked by integrity and upright walking (Proverbs 14:2; Nehemiah 5:15)
  	  - Reverence in worship and caution in speaking or acting in His name (Ecclesiastes 5:1–2; 
    - Negation
      - Not loving the things of the World (1 John 2:15-17, James 4:4)
      - Being not conformed to this present evil age (Romans 12:2, Galatians 1:4)
      - Disproving what God Hates (Proverbs 6:16-19; Psalm 5:4-6; Romans 1:18; Revelation 2:6)
  - Accounts For:
    - Fulfillment of Promises attached to seeking the LORD in obedience (Hebrews 11:6, Psalm 9:10, Deuteronomy 28:1-2, John 15:10)
    - Breathing life into claims of loving the LORD (John 14:23, 1 John 5:3)
    - Not shut out when the door is closed or cast out before the throne (Matthew 25:10-12, Matthew 25:31-46, Luke 13:24-27, Revelation 20:12-15)
    - Being Good Soil (Matthew 13:8, 23; Luke 8:15; Mark 4:20)
  - Considerations:
  - Exceptions:
    - None
  - Limitations
    - Fear of he Lord is a start, an ingredient, a mandatory element but not the whole machine or recipe.()
    - Without ongoing attention, it may fade into familiarity or presumption (Deuteronomy 6:10–12).
    - It may exist alongside distance or trembling (James 2:19). It can be momentary or partial if not accompanied by right understanding and trust. ()
    - Parables: Failures of would-be believers outlined in Jesus' parables identify various elements of failing at Holy Fear of the Lord (Matthew 13:3-23, Matthew 25:1-13, Luke 12:16-21)
  - Inference
    - Love v. Fear v. Faith: Ultimately, Loving God, Faith in God, and Fear of The Lord are at least heavily overlapping, if not identical (1 John 4:18, Hebrews 11:6, Proverbs 8:13).
    - Sanctification: Growing in the richness of fear of the Lord is the primary undertaking of sanctification and vice versa (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, 2 Corinthians 7:1, Proverbs 1:7).
    - Servile fear that paralyzes rather than humbles (Romans 8:15)
    - Fear of man or circumstances disguised as reverence for God (Proverbs 29:25; Isaiah 29:13)
    - External religiosity with no inward awe or repentance (Isaiah 1:11–15; Matthew 15:8–9)
    - Terror without love, leading to avoidance rather than nearness (1 John 4:18)
    - Cultural moralism that mimics uprightness without reference to God’s holiness (2 Timothy 3:5)
- Indwelling of the Holy Spirit
  - **A.K.A. / Associated With / What is Meant By:**
    - The Promise (Acts 1:4-5, Luke 24:49)
    - "The Kingdom is among you" (Luke 17:21, Matthew 12:28)
    - "Whoever does not have Christ's Spirit is none of His." (Romans 8:9, 1 Corinthians 3:16)
  - **Source or Cause of Event, Operation, or Methodology:**
    - Direct provision by the Father at the request of the Son (John 14:16, 26; John 15:26)
    - Entry into the New Covenant through the blood of Christ (Luke 22:20; Hebrews 9:15)
    - Faith in the Eternal Person of Jesus the Christ (Acts 2:38)
    - The Spirit is given to those who hear, believe, and obey (Acts 5:32; Galatians 3:2)
  - **Evidence of Validity or Confirmation**
  - **Affirmation: These indicators serve as signs that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is present and functionally operative:**
      - Confession of Jesus Christ as the eternal and incarnate Son of God (1 John 4:2–3, John 8:24)
      - Receptive belief in the gospel followed by sealed faith response (Ephesians 1:13, Acts 5:32)
      - Internal witness bearing confirmation to the spirit of the person (Romans 8:16)
      - Emergence of spiritual fruit over time, indicating internal transformation (Galatians 5:22–23)
      - Increasing responsiveness to truth, conviction, correction, and renewal (John 16:13, 2 Corinthians 3:18)
    - **Negation: Evidences of reprobacy regarding the Holy Spirit, whether by non-start or terminal grievance. Concluding one's race of faith in this state is exceptionally, gravely dangerous.
      - Reprobate unto every good work or active resistance of the Holy Spirit.(Titus 1:16, 2 Timothy 3:5; Acts 7:51; John 14:17; Hebrews 10:26–29)
      - Denial that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, Lord or come in the flesh (1 John 2:22–23; 1 John 4:2–3; 1 Corinthians 12:3)
      - Love of the world overriding love of truth (1 John 2:15–17)
      - Idolatry, Witchcraft, Occult (1 Corinthians 10:20–21, 1 John 4:1)
  - **Accounts for:**
    - The Power to overcome this World (1 John 5:4, Romans 8:37)
    - The Power to be transformed into the likeness of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18, Romans 12:2)
    - Perpetual access to omnipresent fellowship with the LORD (John 14:16-17, 1 Corinthians 6:19)
    - The internal guidance system for discerning truth and resisting deception (John 16:13, 1 John 2:27)
    - The pledge and down payment guaranteeing future inheritance (Ephesians 1:13–14)
  - Considerations
    - Exemptions:
      - None.  The indwelling is not a requirement but a promise.  Scripture does, however, seem to speak separately between those who believe on the Son and those who do not encounter the protoevangelium or the revealed gospel, or are too young or not sufficiently mentally present.  The Spirit is a requirement for co-heirship with Christ.  
    - Limitations:
      - The indwelling does not prevent soulical recontamination from embracing the world or resisting fear of the Lord. ()
      - The Holy Spirit can be (Acts 7:51), quenched (1 Thessalonians 5:19), grieved (Ephesians 4:30), or neglected (1 Timothy 4:14) which may cause dormancy or be functionally annulled in cases of hardened will or habitual rebellion. Including ignoring guidance or prompts, engaging actions or attitudes incompatible with Spirit, and loving the things of this world (Acts 7:51, 1 Timothy 4:14, Matthew 12:31-32, 1 Thessalonians 5:19, Ephesians 4:30)
    - Inference
      - Indwelling functions as a boundary marker for covenant identity (Romans 8:9) and facilitates communion with God, conviction of sin, empowerment for calling, and spiritual discernment (John 16:8–13). The presence of the Spirit is inseparable from the life of the new covenant and anticipates glorification. Lack of indwelling is correlated with disqualification (Romans 8:14; John 14:17).
    - Alert:
      - Persistent rejection of the Spirit's leading, attribution of His work to evil, or treating His presence as casual may result in spiritual ruin (Matthew 12:31–32; Hebrews 10:29). Spiritual decline often begins by silencing conviction. Rebellion or compromise in practice may lead to a forfeiture of power, awareness, and eventually inheritance (2 Peter 2:20–21; Revelation 3:16).
      - The pull toward an evil heart of unbelief in departing form the Living God can be guarded against by an active life of devotion and pressing into the Lord in praise, prayer, worship, time and meditation in His presence.
    - Corruptions: Heterodoxy, Heresy, Misinterpretation, elicit Spirituality, etc.
      - Depersonalization of the Spirit into an impersonal force, energy, or influence (John 14:26; Ephesians 4:30, Romans 8:9; Galatians 3:2)
      - Spiritualized selfism, equating the Spirit with latent human potential or divine spark (2 Corinthians 11:4)
      - Syncretism, integrating the Holy Spirit with ancestral spirits, universal energies, or pantheistic frameworks (2 Corinthians 6:14–16; 1 Corinthians 10:20–21)
- Foreknown Predestination of Christ The Elect
  - **A.K.A. / Associated With / What is Meant By:**
    - God's Eternal Plan of Redemption (Gen 3:15; 2 Tim 1:9–10; Rev 13:8; Eph 3:11).
    - Election in Christ the Elect One (Isa 42:1; Eph 1:4; 2 Tim 1:9; 1 Pet 1:20, Col 1:15–20; Eph 1:10).
    - Our Redemption, adoption and inheritance (Ephesians 1:3-14; Romans 8:15-17, 23; Galatians 4:4-7; 1 Peter 1:3-5).
  - **Source or Cause of Effects:**
    - Christ foreknown and elect before creation (Isa 42:1; 1 Pet 1:20).
    - Christ slain from the foundation of the world (Rev 13:8; Acts 2:23).
    - God's eternal purpose in Christ (Eph 3:11; 2 Tim 1:9).
    - All things reconciled under Christ’s headship (Col 1:20; Eph 1:10).
  - **Requirement for or Confirmation of Event Taking Place:**
    - Affirmations
      - Spiritual Rebirth — Replacement Human Spirit (John 3:5–6; 2 Cor 5:17; Titus 3:5).
      - Judicial Pardon by the Blood of Christ (Rom 5:1; 2 Cor 5:19; Heb 9:22).
      - Living, Enduring Faith (Heb 10:36; Luke 8:15; John 15:5).
      - Empowerment and Sealing by the Holy Spirit (Rom 8:9–14; Eph 1:13–14).
    - Negations
      - Absence of Apostasy — Not denying Christ (Matt 10:33; 2 Tim 2:12; 1 John 2:23).
  - **Accounts For:**
    - Adoption as Sons and Daughters (Eph 1:5; Rom 8:15–17; Gal 4:4–7).
    - Conformity to the Image of Christ (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 John 3:2).
    - Glorification and Immortality (Rom 8:30; 1 Cor 15:49–54; Phil 3:21).
    - Corporate Body Identity — Church as His Body (Eph 1:22–23; 1 Cor 12:12–27).
    - Cosmic Reconciliation — Creation set free in Him (Rom 8:19–22; Col 1:20).
  - **Considerations:**
    - Assignment to the Elect Body is corporate, not individually predetermined (Eph 1:4; 2 Pet 1:10).
    - Union with Christ is sustained by abiding faith, energized by the Spirit (John 15:4–6; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:14).
    - Romans 9 addresses vocational and covenantal election, not pretemporal individual salvation (Rom 9:6–8, 11–13; Gen 25:23).
    - **Vocational Implications:**
    - The Elect are a royal priesthood, called to proclaim His excellencies (1 Pet 2:9).
    - Believers are ambassadors of reconciliation (2 Cor 5:20).
    - Election is unto holiness and mission (Eph 1:4; Matt 5:14–16).
    - **Alert:**
    - Abandoning Christ forfeits participation in the predestined glorification (John 15:6; Heb 6:4–6; 2 Pet 2:20–22).
    - Eternal inheritance belongs only to those who overcome (Rev 2:7,11; 21:7–8).
    - Name in the Book of Life is contingent on perseverance (Rev 3:5; 20:15; Matt 10:22).
