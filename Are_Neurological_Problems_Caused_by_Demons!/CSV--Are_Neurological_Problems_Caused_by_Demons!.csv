0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.880,4.880000114440918," The thing that bugs me about this kind of thing is it always leaves the person who's suffering,"
1,00:00:04.880,00:00:07.679,2.799999713897705," they're always the problem. They don't have enough faith,"
2,00:00:07.679,00:00:11.119,3.440000057220459," they don't have enough belief in this or that. Again, how would you know?"
3,00:00:11.119,00:00:15.919,4.799999237060547, Question. I've been told that I have a stronghold due to my neurological issues.
4,00:00:15.919,00:00:21.039,5.120000839233398, I've been told this is the enemy. How do I speak to my family from truth in scripture?
5,00:00:21.039,00:00:27.920,6.880001068115234," How would they know? In other words, where's the guide biblically that would align a physical or"
6,00:00:27.920,00:00:33.600,5.680000305175781," neurological condition with a spiritual power? I mean, where's the list? I mean,"
7,00:00:33.600,00:00:39.760,6.159999847412109, we have the American Medical Association guide to disease. Where's the biblical equivalent to this?
8,00:00:39.760,00:00:45.600,5.840000152587891, How do we know is the question. How do they know? The reality is they're guessing. It's an opinion.
9,00:00:45.600,00:00:52.000,6.400001525878906," There might be a connection, but how would we know? So I think positively in our prayer for"
10,00:00:52.000,00:00:59.200,7.200000762939453," people, either for ourselves or for other people on their behalf, we need to be open and acknowledge"
11,00:00:59.200,00:01:04.880,5.680000305175781," that there may be a spiritual issue, a spiritual force here behind this problem. But on the other"
12,00:01:04.880,00:01:11.679,6.799995422363281," hand, if there are clear neurological diagnoses here and clear therapies, then I think we would"
13,00:01:11.679,00:01:19.280,7.600006103515625, be foolish to not use those things. Who created the world? The answer would be God. And God creates
14,00:01:19.280,00:01:25.679,6.399993896484375," the world with things like plants, and plants have certain properties. And as we grow in our"
15,00:01:25.679,00:01:31.840,6.160003662109375," knowledge of creation, we learn what these things do to our bodies, and they get developed into"
16,00:01:31.840,00:01:37.600,5.760002136230469, therapies and medicines. This is a biblical worthwhile enterprise. It's called the dominion
17,00:01:37.600,00:01:43.920,6.319999694824219," mandate. It goes all the way back to Adam and Eve, that we are supposed to master creation."
18,00:01:43.920,00:01:50.960,7.040000915527344," We are supposed to be steward kings of the planet. And that involves knowing what the planet does,"
19,00:01:50.960,00:01:57.040,6.0800018310546875," knowing what's on it, knowing what effects it has, knowing what plants do, knowing what animals do,"
20,00:01:57.040,00:02:02.320,5.279998779296875," knowing how these things interact, knowing their effect on us. I mean, this is all stuff that we're"
21,00:02:02.320,00:02:08.400,6.0800018310546875, supposed to be learning and knowing and doing in the name of the creator. This is a legitimate
22,00:02:08.400,00:02:14.639,6.239990234375, pursuit. How do we know if one thing falls into one bucket or another bucket? The honest answer
23,00:02:14.639,00:02:20.639,6.0," is we don't. And if we take it up to another notch, another question, well, what should I do"
24,00:02:20.639,00:02:26.720,6.0800018310546875," in relationship to this problem I have, this disease I have? Should I ignore one bucket and"
25,00:02:26.720,00:02:32.560,5.8400115966796875," only work in the second bucket? Or should I switch buckets or whatever? The answer is,"
26,00:02:32.560,00:02:39.040,6.4799957275390625," if you don't know, you should be open to all of it and let the Lord heal using whatever means"
27,00:02:39.040,00:02:45.920,6.8800048828125, he chooses to use at any given point within the sovereignty of God. But to tell people you have
28,00:02:45.920,00:02:51.680,5.7599945068359375," this and it's caused by that without any proof, that's what they're doing. They have no proof."
29,00:02:51.680,00:02:59.520,7.839996337890625, They have a possibility. Possibilities are not proofs. Let me say it again. Possibilities
30,00:02:59.520,00:03:06.880,7.3600006103515625," are not proofs. Evidence isn't even proof. These are different things. They're related,"
31,00:03:06.880,00:03:11.999,5.1199951171875, but different ideas. And we need to start thinking a little more clearly if we're going to really be
32,00:03:11.999,00:03:17.279,5.279998779296875, helpful to ourselves and to other people. The thing that bugs me about this kind of thing
33,00:03:17.279,00:03:21.279,4.0," is it always leaves the person who's suffering, they're always the problem."
34,00:03:21.279,00:03:25.520,4.2400054931640625," They don't have enough faith. They don't have enough belief in this or that. Again, how would"
35,00:03:25.520,00:03:32.479,6.959991455078125, you know? It's awfully arrogant to assess somebody else's faith in something. They might have faith
36,00:03:32.479,00:03:37.600,5.1200103759765625," in it, consider it a very real possibility. They may make it a matter of prayer every day."
37,00:03:37.600,00:03:43.040,5.44000244140625," Lord, if my condition is due to some spiritual power, I pray that you would have victory over"
38,00:03:43.040,00:03:48.160,5.1199951171875, it. They might be doing that every day. And who are you to think that they're not doing that?
39,00:03:48.160,00:03:53.040,4.8800048828125, Who are you to think that their faith isn't sufficient? You always get to blame the person
40,00:03:53.040,00:03:58.160,5.1199951171875," suffering when you take this tag, unless it's yourself, then you find a way to deflect it"
41,00:03:58.160,00:03:59.919,1.7599945068359375, in the event of somebody else's problem.
