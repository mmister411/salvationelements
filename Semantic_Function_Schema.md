The Semantic Function Schema is a structured tool for analyzing any spiritual, ethical, conceptual, or operational element by mapping its meaning, function, triggers, evidence, boundaries, and distortions. It is not a summary or overview. It is a logic-based, condition-aware diagnostic form designed to describe what something is called, what it does, how it works, and under what conditions it operates.

Below is a description of the template, followed by what is entailed in filling it out.

**Functional/Mechanical/Concretely Descriptive Item Title**

The item under review must be named according to what it does or how it operates, not by its theological label.  
This forces clarity and avoids conceptual fog.  
Name by identifying a distinct mechanism that points to specific mechanical realities while avoiding generalities.  
Generalization that seems unavoidable likely indicates the need for multiple separate functional enumerations.

**Subsections**

**A.K.A. / Associated With / What is Meant By**  
Maps the primary concept to alternate terms, phrases, or conceptual synonyms used in related domains or texts. Establishes semantic and functional equivalence across different terminologies.  Facilitates cross-contextual recognition of the same underlying idea.Bridges linguistic or categorical variation without redefining core meaning. Should be as comprehensive a list as possible. 

**Source or Cause of Event, Operation, or Methodology**  
Identifies the origin, initiating agent, mechanism, or process that produces the described condition or state. This can be a divine action, doctrinal mechanism, spiritual agency, spiritual law, human action, or situational triggers, etcetera. Clarifies procedural logic or systemic operations that underlie the result by attributes causality or agency to a specific sources in order to  Clarifies procedural logic or systemic operations that underlie the result. Clarifies the mechanism (how it happens), whether miraculous, legal, spiritual, or instructional. May or may not be list of synonyms; some elements, funddtions or operations have mulitple potential or actual sources or causes. 

**Requirement for or Confirmation of Event Taking Place**  
Defines prerequisites or validating signals associated with the occurrence or authenticity of the described element. Separates necessary conditions from incidental factors by setting criteria for qualification or participation through including both confirming evidence (affirmation) and disqualifying evidence (negation) to enhance diagnostic clarity. Outlines the conditions that must be met for the element to occur or the signs that confirm it has taken place. This section often splits into two subparts:
- **Affirmation:**  
  List the positive evidences that the function is genuinely present or has occurred. These should be scripturally traceable and observable in principle.  
- **Negation:**  
  Identify what excludes the function. List conditions that contradict, nullify, or disqualify its presence, activation or fact of having occurred. Specifies what disqualifies or invalidates the presence of the element. Identifies opposing states, attitudes, or actions.

**Accounts For**  
Explains what outcomes, consequences, or effects are resolved, enabled, or expressed by the concept in question. Clarifies the role or utility of the element within a larger framework. Attributes changes or statuses to the element's operation. hows its explanatory power relative to downstream results or conditions.  This section captures its effects, benefits, or logical outputs.

**Considerations**  
- **Exemptions:**  
  Specify who or what is not subject to this function due to scriptural precedent or other qualifying boundaries.  Exemptions identify subjects or conditions that are excluded from standard requirements. These exemptions are based on developmental, cognitive, moral, or situational factors. They define who or what is not bound by typical obligations. They maintain clarity by separating normative function from exception status. They ensure that the concept applies justly and consistently within its stated bounds.
- **Limitations:**  
  Define what the function does not do or where it fails to operate fully. Identify known weak points, incomplete applications, or time-bound constraints. Limitations describe the boundaries of the element's effectiveness, duration, or independence. They clarify what the element does not cover or cannot accomplish in isolation. They highlight where the function is partial, conditional, or dependent on further action or integration. They prevent category error by restricting overextension of claims. They keep the element within its operational lane.  
- **Inferences:**  
  Include necessary or likely deductions from scriptural patterns. This allows derived logic without speculative abstraction.   Inferences derive conclusions based on the internal logic of the element. They express connections that follow necessarily or reasonably from the element’s defined role. They allow extension from explicit statements to implications or consequences. They facilitate integration with other concepts or frameworks. They produce coherence by linking element-level data to system-level understanding.
- **Alerts:**  
  Identify common dangers, distortions, or spiritual vulnerabilities associated with misapplying, faking, or misrepresenting the function.  
- **Corruptions:**  
Corruptions identify distortions that mimic, replace, or misrepresent the function or identity of the element. They include heterodox teachings, conceptual substitutions, and structural imitations that obscure or counterfeit the original. They encompass heresies, pseudoscientific claims, revisionist interpretations, and philosophical constructs incompatible with the framework. They expose systems that deviate from the intended function while often retaining its language or external form. They clarify the boundary between authentic operation and misleading replication.

### **Filling It Out: What It Entails**

1. **Discipline in Functional Naming**
   Avoid inherited, symbolic, or abstract naming. Every title must describe a specific mechanism or operation in functional terms. This forces the analyst to identify observable or definable behavior rather than labeling by tradition or category. A functional title describes what the item does, not what it represents.

2. **Traceability to Scripture**
   Each input must be anchored in direct textual statement, recurring pattern, or logically supportable inference from scriptural data. The analyst must gather, organize, and align references with precision. Avoid speculative or analogical claims unless they arise from controlled, repeatable textual patterns. No claim should appear that cannot be defended by scriptural traceability.

3. **Conditional Reasoning**
   All content must be structured around conditional logic rather than static assertion. Every line should answer one of the following diagnostic prompts:

* What causes this?
* What prevents this?
* What confirms this?
* What results from this?
  This format enforces clarity about triggers, disqualifiers, verifiers, and effects and must govern all sections.

4. **Distinguishing Necessary from Corollary**
   Each entry must be evaluated for whether it is **required**, **sufficient**, or **correlated but non-essential**. This prevents conceptual overload or overstatement. The analyst must not conflate accompanying conditions with determining ones and must clarify functional weight wherever applicable.

5. **Attention to Edge Cases**
   Functional description must include boundary conditions. This requires identifying:

* Subjects or states that are exempt
* Cases where function initiates but does not complete
* Mimic conditions that falsely appear valid
  These cases protect the diagnostic from false generalization and reinforce accuracy in irregular or exceptional situations.

6. **Reference Density and Scriptural Saturation**
   Each subsection must demonstrate high scriptural reference density. Single references are insufficient unless uniquely definitive. The analyst must prioritize multi-point validation through recurring usage, canonical breadth, and contextual repetition. A high concentration of traceable references is a quality standard, not an optional enhancement.
