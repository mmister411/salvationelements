### Sin

Sin exerts effects on the world that suggest it is almost a self-contained entity, but ultimately, it is not. Sin is rogue agency presenting as authentic reality while pseudo-symbiotically self-usurping its host. Sin conscripts into a corrupted rebellion against God, self, and other creatures. Sin's seductive sedition can neither succeed nor cease, even when nothing remains but the irretrievably abominable self in perpetuity. Sin cannot be remedied. But breathing souls can be rescued, redeemed, and reconstructed by blood, by water, and by the Holy Spirit. Like unclean spirits expelled to dry places, sin seeks to resist remission and reclaim the vessel it once controlled. By Holy Spirit’s power, the willing overcome; the unwilling are overrun. Sin is dangerous but defeatable, never to be feared, always to be resisted, and never to be underestimated.

Beyond being a corrupting pseudo-force, sin is also the name for thoughts, communication, activities, and decisions contrary to what the self knows to be good, lawful, and faithful. All good things originate with the Lord, so even people who have not received scriptural revelation are unknowingly aligning themselves with the Lord when they choose what is good. 

Sin originates at the willful departure of any creature from the Living God. The corruptive effects of sin on the biosphere, causal effects on history, or judicial ramifications upon a group membership can be inherited. The guilt, indebtedness, or individual liability of sin cannot be inherited. Adam’s sin doomed the flesh of all his descendants to corruption of the physical livelihood of material bodies and natural dispositions of thier souls. Through Adam, every instance of Adamic life will naturally end at least once. However, the breath of God, which gives life to all, is not of Adam’s seed but is the light that enlightens every person conceived in the world. 

It is personal sin that necessitates being born again. Personal sin severs the functional connection between the human soul and its original spirit, rendering the person dead in trespasses and sins to healthy spiritual functionality. The remedy for this psychopneumatic death is the impartation of a new spirit by the Father’s breath, creating a renewed human spirit. This spiritual rebirth accounts for regaining functionality innate to the human spirit but does nothing for the soulical corruption caused by sin or the eternal debt incurred from sinning.  The payout of the debt of personal sin is dimensional exile to a place fit to suffer the eternal judicial sentencing attached to that or many sins. 

It is impossible to catalog every act that might constitute sin in all places and all times. Nevertheless, scripture provides hundreds of named transgressions, many of which extend beyond the localized contexts of Sinai, Jerusalem, or Galilee. Just as Jesus shows that hate is murder and that extramarital mental fantasizing is still committing adultery, we learn that the concepts of the letter and the spirit of the letter are profoundly significant both within and beyond the letter of the word.

It is possible to sum up primary root themes that provide a helpful compass for navigating sin's tangled forest of corrupted fruit. Despite not being comprehensive, any student of the word may still find assistance.

Nearly all sin is some form or blend of malice, idolatry, treachery, or exploitation. These four categories provide interpretive clarity. They offer diagnostic value: “Am I being malicious?” “Is activity idolatrous?” “Am I betraying a trust?” “Am I unjustly exploiting a person or opportunity?” Among several potential benefits, this kind of moral taxonomy creates a kind of spiritual system of checks and balances. It allows the student of scripture to trace unseen connections between sins through enlisting the bright spots in our personal experience to shed light on blind spots we didn't know were related. Understanding the structure of sin, even imperfectly, sharpens our capacity to resist it faithfully.

#### Hermeneutical Disclaimer:

This analysis proceeds on the methodological assumption that theology must arise traceably from exegesis of the text. All readings and conclusions must respect immediate literary and historical context while additionally being apt to consider wider material from the given book and canon as applicable. Systematic theology, interpretive tradition, naming conventions, science, archaeology, and philosophy possess intrinsic value as disciplines. Use of these disciplines must not override textual content that is explicitly stated or cogently inferable or import semiotic artifacts untenably foreign to its original information environment. Interpretive lenses are necessarily embedded in any interpretive operation of scripture but must not weigh in at the expense of the text’s self-defined logos, ethos, or pathos.

## MITE Framework

The M.I.T.E. (Malice, Idolatry, Treachery, Exploitation) Hamartiology Taxonomy is a comprehensive categorization of sins, each reflecting a particular aspect of human failings and moral shortcomings from a Christian theological perspective. Here's an analysis of each category:

Malice

Rooted in hate and hostility, malice represents actions and attitudes that directly harm others or intend to do so. Biblically, this is condemned in numerous passages (e.g., Romans 1:29, Ephesians 4:31).
Subcategories like mercilessness, murder, discrimination, and cruelty are explicitly rebuked in scripture (e.g., 1 John 3:15, James 2:13).
Discord, as a subcategory, encapsulates behaviors that disrupt unity and peace, contrary to the Biblical exhortation for harmony (Romans 12:16-18, 1 Corinthians 1:10).
Vengeance contradicts the Biblical teaching that vengeance belongs to God, and humans are called to forgive (Romans 12:19, Matthew 6:15).
Apathy, especially indifference and neglect, is contrary to the Christian call to love and care for others (1 John 3:17-18).
Idolatry

This category encompasses sins that place something or someone in the position of God in one's life, directly violating the first of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:3).
Perversion, including sexual immorality and unnatural desires, is frequently condemned in the Bible (1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Romans 1:26-27).
Lust, in its many forms, is a sin against one’s own body and against God, who calls for purity (Matthew 5:28, 1 Corinthians 6:18).
Witchcraft and related practices are considered rebellion against God (Deuteronomy 18:10-12, Galatians 5:19-21).
Avarice, or extreme greed, is idolatry as it puts material wealth before God (Colossians 3:5, 1 Timothy 6:10).
Treachery

This category deals with betrayal and deception, actions condemned throughout the Bible.
Deception, including lying and false witness, is contrary to God’s nature of truth (Proverbs 12:22, Ephesians 4:25).
Breach, such as adultery and disloyalty, undermines trust and covenants, both human and divine (Exodus 20:14, Hebrews 13:4).
Theft, in any form, is directly prohibited by the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:15) and is considered an injustice to others.
Exploitation

This category focuses on the misuse of power and authority to take advantage of others.
Oppression, including injustice and abuse, is against the Biblical call to justice and care for the marginalized (Isaiah 1:17, James 2:6).
Merchandising, in the sense of exploiting others for personal gain, is condemned (2 Peter 2:3, Matthew 21:12-13).
Control, through coercion or manipulation, is contrary to the Biblical principle of freedom in Christ and the call to serve others in love (Galatians 5:13, 2 Corinthians 1:24).

This taxonomy highlights the need for human beings to seek redemption and transformation through Christ, recognizing the pervasive nature of sin in every aspect of human life and society.
