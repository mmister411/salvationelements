### Introduction
Sin is almost a thing unto itself but ultimately is not.  Sin is rogue agency presenting as authentic reality while pseudo-symbiotically self usurping its host. Sin conscripts into a corrupted rebellion against God, self and other creatures that can neither succeed nor cease, even when nothing remains but the irretrievably abominable self in perpetuity. Sin cannot be remedied but breathing souls can be rescued, redeemed and reconstructed by blood, water and Holy Spirit.

#### Hermeneutical Disclaimer:

This analysis proceeds on the methodological assumption that theology must arise traceably from exegesis of the text.  All readings and conclusions must respect immediate literary and historical context, while additionally being apt to consider wider material from the given book and canon as applicable. Systematic theology, interpretive tradition, naming conventions, science, archaeology, and philosophy possess intrinsic value as disciplines.  Use of these disciplines must not override textual content that is explicitly stated or cogently inferable or import semiotic artifacts untenably foreign to its original information environment. Interpretive lenses are necessarily embedded in any interpretive operation of scripture but must not weigh in at the expense of the text’s self defined logos, ethos or pathos.

## MITE Framework

The M.I.T.E. (Malice, Idolatry, Treachery, Exploitation) Hamartiology Taxonomy is a comprehensive categorization of sins, each reflecting a particular aspect of human failings and moral shortcomings from a Christian theological perspective. Here's an analysis of each category:

Malice

Rooted in hate and hostility, malice represents actions and attitudes that directly harm others or intend to do so. Biblically, this is condemned in numerous passages (e.g., Romans 1:29, Ephesians 4:31).
Subcategories like mercilessness, murder, discrimination, and cruelty are explicitly rebuked in scripture (e.g., 1 John 3:15, James 2:13).
Discord, as a subcategory, encapsulates behaviors that disrupt unity and peace, contrary to the Biblical exhortation for harmony (Romans 12:16-18, 1 Corinthians 1:10).
Vengeance contradicts the Biblical teaching that vengeance belongs to God, and humans are called to forgive (Romans 12:19, Matthew 6:15).
Apathy, especially indifference and neglect, is contrary to the Christian call to love and care for others (1 John 3:17-18).
Idolatry

This category encompasses sins that place something or someone in the position of God in one's life, directly violating the first of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:3).
Perversion, including sexual immorality and unnatural desires, is frequently condemned in the Bible (1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Romans 1:26-27).
Lust, in its many forms, is a sin against one’s own body and against God, who calls for purity (Matthew 5:28, 1 Corinthians 6:18).
Witchcraft and related practices are considered rebellion against God (Deuteronomy 18:10-12, Galatians 5:19-21).
Avarice, or extreme greed, is idolatry as it puts material wealth before God (Colossians 3:5, 1 Timothy 6:10).
Treachery

This category deals with betrayal and deception, actions condemned throughout the Bible.
Deception, including lying and false witness, is contrary to God’s nature of truth (Proverbs 12:22, Ephesians 4:25).
Breach, such as adultery and disloyalty, undermines trust and covenants, both human and divine (Exodus 20:14, Hebrews 13:4).
Theft, in any form, is directly prohibited by the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:15) and is considered an injustice to others.
Exploitation

This category focuses on the misuse of power and authority to take advantage of others.
Oppression, including injustice and abuse, is against the Biblical call to justice and care for the marginalized (Isaiah 1:17, James 2:6).
Merchandising, in the sense of exploiting others for personal gain, is condemned (2 Peter 2:3, Matthew 21:12-13).
Control, through coercion or manipulation, is contrary to the Biblical principle of freedom in Christ and the call to serve others in love (Galatians 5:13, 2 Corinthians 1:24).

### Malice

1.  Hate and its Manifestations:

    -   Mercilessness: Contrary to the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:7), which bless the merciful, showing a lack of mercy indicates a hardening of the heart.
    -   Murder: Violates the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13). Jesus expands this to include anger and contempt (Matthew 5:21-22).
    -   Discrimination: Goes against the principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself (Galatians 3:28, James 2:9).
    -   Reviling and Cruelty: Contradicts the call to bless and not curse (Romans 12:14).
    -   Enmity and Hostility: Inconsistent with the call to peace and reconciliation (Romans 12:18).
2.  Discord:

    -   Quarrels to Divisions: All these actions disrupt the unity that Christ prayed for His followers (John 17:21) and Paul urged in the church (1 Corinthians 1:10).
    -   Selfishness and Seditions: Selfish ambition leads to disorder and evil practices (James 3:16).
    -   Rivalries: Indicative of worldly desires, contrary to a spirit-led life (Galatians 5:19-21).
3.  Vengeance:

    -   Retaliation to Bitterness: These feelings and actions are warned against, as believers are called to forgive (Ephesians 4:31-32) and leave vengeance to God (Romans 12:19).
    -   Wrath and Fury: Human anger does not produce the righteousness of God (James 1:20).
4.  Apathy:

    -   Indifference to Unforgiveness: Indicates a lack of love, which is central to Christian ethics (1 John 4:20-21).

### Idolatry

1.  Perversion:

    -   From Pedophilia to Licentiousness: These acts are condemned as they deviate from God's design for human sexuality and degrade human dignity (1 Corinthians 6:18-20).
2.  Lust:

    -   From Hedonism to Debauchery: Reflects a pursuit of fleshly desires over spiritual ones, contrary to living by the Spirit (Galatians 5:16-17).
3.  Witchcraft:

    -   From Iconolatry to Channeling: These practices are seen as direct rebellion against God, seeking power and knowledge outside of Him (Deuteronomy 18:10-12).
4.  Avarice:

    -   From Covetousness to Haughtiness: Represents a love for the material world over God, contradicting the command to love God above all (Matthew 6:24).

### Treachery

1.  Deception:

    -   From Craftiness to Slander: All forms of deception are against God's nature of truth and honesty (Proverbs 6:16-19, Ephesians 4:25).
2.  Breach:

    -   From Adultery to Gossip: Breach of trust and relational integrity, contrary to the call for faithfulness in relationships (Hebrews 13:4, Proverbs 11:13).
3.  Theft:

    -   From Swindling to Stealing: Violates the commandment against stealing and principles of justice and fairness (Exodus 20:15, Ephesians 4:28).

### Exploitation

1.  Oppression:

    -   From Injustice to Discrimination: Oppression of any form is against the biblical mandate for justice and care for the vulnerable (Psalm 82:3, Isaiah 1:17).
2.  Merchandising:

    -   From Capitalization to Utilization: Using others for personal gain is against the ethic of serving and loving others selflessly (Philippians 2:3-4).
3.  Control:

    -   From Coercion to Gaslighting: Manipulating or controlling others is contrary to the freedom and dignity that Christianity upholds for every individual (Galatians 5:13, 2 Corinthians 3:17).

In summary, the M.I.T.E. taxonomy provides a detailed and expansive view of sin, encompassing a wide range of human behaviors and attitudes that are contrary to the teachings and character of God as revealed in the Bible. This taxonomy highlights the need for human beings to seek redemption and transformation through Christ, recognizing the pervasive nature of sin in every aspect of human life and society.
